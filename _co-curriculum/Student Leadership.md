<p>Our approach to student leadership development is guided by the following
principles:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every Gessian is an Exemplary Leader who Serves, Leads and Excels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To nurture every Gessian to be leaders of character and prepare our Gessians
to be future-ready citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gessians have the potential to be developed into principled leaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide platforms for Gessians to apply their leadership skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The overarching purpose of student leadership development is to develop
Gessians as principled leaders of self and others, imbued with the school
values of Integrity, Compassion, Resilience, Discipline and Respect.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Pedagogical Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Leadership Committee seeks to mould Gessians into principled
leaders through a progressive leadership development plan, incorporating
the 5 Practices of The Leadership Challenge.</p>
<p>Each level has a progressive leadership focus starting from Self-Leadership
in Sec 1, Peer-Leadership in Sec 2, School-Leadership in Sec 3, and culminating
in Mentor-Leadership in Sec 4/5. We strive to help Gessians to discover
their leadership abilities through our cohort training programme. Platforms
have been put in place for students to learn and demonstrate leadership
skills by integrating leadership teaching and learning at various school
activities and programmes.</p>
<p>GESS has a series of developmental leadership training and opportunities
to actualize every student’s potential to serve the school and community.
The student leadership committee aims to develop and implement segmented
student leadership training programmes for identified student leaders to
be effective in their roles to serve the school. Student Leaders Camp takes
place to help the leaders in developing strong working relationships and
sharpening their leadership skills.</p>
<p>In addition to the basic leadership development for all students, an advanced
leadership development is designed to stretch our core Student Leaders
(Prefects, CCA Leaders, Class Chairpersons, Peer Support Leaders and Sports
Leaders). Student Leaders are empowered to lead their classes, CCAs and
peers in various school activities such as Secondary 1 GESS Camp, Election
of Head Prefect, Teachers’ and Support Staff Day, Student Leaders Camp,
Student Leaders Appointment Ceremony etc, as well as conducting outreach
programmes to cluster Primary Schools and community. The following infographic
shows how the Student Leaders are organized in GESS:</p>
