<h2>Gan Eng Seng School</h2><h4><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h4><h4>Introduction&nbsp;</h4><p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters in their growing up years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is taught in the context of values which our mainstream society believes in:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>the importance of the family as the basic unit of society,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages, and&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities on sexuality issues.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Sexuality Education focuses on the development of adolescents' values, and social and emotional competencies required to make responsible decisions regarding sexual behaviours and to build rewarding relationships based on love and respect which are the foundation for strong families.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also named Sexuality Education (rather than Sex Education) to emphasise the holistic approach which includes the emotional, social, intellectual and ethical aspects, in addition to the physical aspect of sex.</p><p><strong>Sexuality Education covers the following dimensions of a person’s sexuality:</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Physical:</strong>&nbsp;Physical sexual maturation and intimacy, the physiology of sex and human reproduction;</p></li><li><p><strong>Emotional:&nbsp;</strong>Sexual attitudes and feelings towards self and others;</p></li><li><p><strong>Social:&nbsp;</strong>Sexual norms and behaviour and their legal, cultural and societal implications; and</p></li><li><p><strong>Ethical:&nbsp;</strong>Values and moral systems related to sexuality.​</p></li></ul><h4>Key Messages, Goals and Guiding Principles​</h4><p><strong><em>The four key messages of Sexuality Education are:</em></strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unwanted pregnancies.

The Tug-of-War facilitation strategy gives students the opportunity to consider the perspectives of both parties involved in the conflict.
