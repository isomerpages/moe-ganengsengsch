<h2>Gan Eng Seng School</h2><h4><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h4><h4>Introduction&nbsp;</h4><p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters in their growing up years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is taught in the context of values which our mainstream society believes in:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>the importance of the family as the basic unit of society,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages, and&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities on sexuality issues.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Sexuality Education focuses on the development of adolescents' values, and social and emotional competencies required to make responsible decisions regarding sexual behaviours and to build rewarding relationships based on love and respect which are the foundation for strong families.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also named Sexuality Education (rather than Sex Education) to emphasise the holistic approach which includes the emotional, social, intellectual and ethical aspects, in addition to the physical aspect of sex.</p><p><strong>Sexuality Education covers the following dimensions of a person’s sexuality:</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Physical:</strong>&nbsp;Physical sexual maturation and intimacy, the physiology of sex and human reproduction;</p></li><li><p><strong>Emotional:&nbsp;</strong>Sexual attitudes and feelings towards self and others;</p></li><li><p><strong>Social:&nbsp;</strong>Sexual norms and behaviour and their legal, cultural and societal implications; and</p></li><li><p><strong>Ethical:&nbsp;</strong>Values and moral systems related to sexuality.​</p></li></ul><h4>Key Messages, Goals and Guiding Principles​</h4><p><strong><em>The four key messages of Sexuality Education are:</em></strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unwanted pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p><p></p></li></ul><p><strong><em>The three goals of Sexuality Education are:</em></strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate knowledge on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of social and emotional skills of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the heterosexual married couple forming a nuclear family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality.</p><p></p></li></ul><p><strong><em>The key guiding principles of Sexuality Education are:&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Home</strong></p></li></ul><p>Parents play the primary role in the sexuality education of their children. As such, they are responsible for the teaching and transmission of values on sex and sexuality. Recognising that parents have a key role in the sexuality education of their children, they can exercise their choice to opt their children out of the school’s sexuality education programme;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>​​School</strong></p></li></ul><p>The teaching of knowledge and skills is integrated with the teaching of values which reflect that of Singapore’s mainstream society, to help students ​make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p><p>In accordance with our national values, Sexuality Education is premised on the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and building stable nuclear family units with extended family support.</p><p>Only specially-selected teachers are trained to teach Sexuality Education. These teachers are selected because they:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>believe in the importance of sexuality education for students;</p></li><li><p>possess values that are aligned with MOE values in Sexuality Education;</p></li><li><p>are comfortable discussing sexuality issues; and</p></li><li><p>have healthy rapport with students and possess good facilitation skills.</p></li></ul><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Community&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ul><p>In recognition of our multi-racial and multi-religious society, students and teachers will respect the different attitudes, values and beliefs regarding sexuality that these different communities may have.</p><p>Relevant resources in the community that are in alignment with MOE Sexuality Education Framework and Implementation Guidelines may be brought in to supplement schools' sexuality education programmes where needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>At Gan Eng Seng School, the following lessons from the Sexuality Education Programme will be taught in&nbsp;<u>2024:</u></strong></p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Secondary 1</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Unit</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Lesson Title / Duration</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Lesson Overview</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Lesson Objectives<br><br><strong>At the end of the lesson, students will be able to:</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Time Period</strong><br><br><strong>(e.g. Term 1 Week 2)</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" colspan="1"><p>Respectful Relationships &amp; Safety</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Steady or Not <br>Lesson 1<br>(60 mins)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>The lesson helps students understand more about relationship building and the different types of love (e.g. familial, platonic, romantic).
