<p><strong><u>Vision for GESS CARES</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Gessians are active contributors who are willing to act and serve others.</p>
<p><strong><u>Desired Student Outcomes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>By the end of 4/5 years, Gessians would have</p>
<p>路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences in the various
aspects of community service</p>
<p>路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developed a sense of
compassion for the less privileged and fortunate</p>
<p>路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grown a heart of service
to the community &amp; beyond</p>
<p>路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developed 21CC skills
in adaptive &amp; inventive thinking and communication</p>
<p>GESS CARES is a valuable student development experience that GESS provides
for our students to nurture them into active citizens with the heart to
serve the community.</p>
<p>GESS CARES encourages student ownership and initiative, providing a platform
where students reflect on their experiences, the values they have put into
practice, and how they can contribute meaningfully to impact the people
they interact with.</p>
<p>Design thinking framework is used when planning the VIA activities to
allow students to interact with people from all walks of life and visit
different places to learn and grow the required skills and dispositions.
The design thinking approach encourages creative, client-centric problem-solving
skills. It also develops teamwork and creativity.</p>
