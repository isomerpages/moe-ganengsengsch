<p><strong><u>Vision</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture Gessians into active citizens who serve with compassion and
who love Singapore.</p>
<p><strong><u>About us</u></strong>
</p>
<p>VIA is a valuable student development experience that GESS provides for
our students to nurture them into active citizens with the heart to serve
others in the community with compassion.</p>
<p>Besides the activity alone, GESSCares encourages student ownership and
initiative, providing a platform where students reflect on their experiences,
the values they have put into practice, and how they can contribute meaningfully
to impact the people they interact with. We adopt the&nbsp;<strong>3P (People, Places, exPeriences)</strong>&nbsp;approach
when planning the VIA activities to allow students to interact with different
people from all walks of life and visit different places to learn.</p>
<p>Key VIA activities include:</p>
