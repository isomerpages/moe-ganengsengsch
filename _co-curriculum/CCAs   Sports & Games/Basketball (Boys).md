    <td class="tg-h5mn" colspan="3">The GESS Basketball Team is made up of both the “B” Boys and “C” Boys. We train together to improve our skills, teamwork, and game strategies. <br><br>This year, we worked hard to prepare for the National School Games Basketball Championships. During our CCA sessions, our student leaders led us through resistance and plyometric training to help us get stronger and faster.
We also joined external competitions and played friendly matches to gain experience and improve our awareness during games. <br><br>Every training session pushes us to build our stamina, sharpen our skills, and strengthen our bond as a team.
Most importantly, we always remind ourselves to live up to the GESS values of Discipline, Integrity, Respect, Resilience, and Compassion. <br><br>Together, we enjoy every moment of our basketball journey as one GESS family.</td>
