    <td class="tg-h5mn" colspan="3">The GESS Canoeing team goes to MacRitchie Reservoir for their weekly water trainings to build up water confidence and individual skills in preparation for competitions. Additionally, all members will undergo the One Star Kayaking Course certified by the Singapore Canoe Federation, to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge and ability to handle the sport. Through the regular trainings, competitions, and Values-in-Action experiences, the CCA seeks to foster leadership qualities, team bonding and discipline among the team members.
