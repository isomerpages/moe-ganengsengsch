    <td class="tg-h5mn" colspan="3">The GESS Canoeing Team trains regularly at MacRitchie Reservoir, where members hone their paddling techniques, build water confidence, and push their physical limits in preparation for competitions. Through rigorous water and land training sessions, canoeists continuously sharpen their skills and grow in endurance and resilience. All members also undergo the One Star Kayaking Course accredited by the Singapore Canoe Federation, equipping them with essential safety knowledge and technical competencies. Beyond the sport, the CCA emphasises teamwork, discipline, and leadership through competitions and Values-in-Action experiences, fostering well-rounded individuals who strive for excellence on and off the water.
