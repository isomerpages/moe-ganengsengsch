<p>Dragon Scouts is the oldest uniformed group in Gan Eng Seng School. Established
in 1922, Dragon Scouts has been closely tied to the development of Gan
Eng Seng School. Throughout the years of history, Dragon Scouts has produced
many successful professionals and has helped to shape the development of
Gan Eng Seng School. A good example will be the school colours, red and
green which were adopted from the scarf found in Dragon Scouts.
<br>
<br>Scouting is unique because it engages a Scout in a whole range of activities.
In pursuit of these activities, the Scout attains various proficiency standards
which reinforce positive self-esteem. Furthermore, Scouting allows promising
Scouts who set higher standards for themselves to become President’s Scouts,
an honour which no other uniformed youth organization can boast of.
<br>
<br>Be Prepared’, the motto of all Scouts, captures the essence of Scouting.
Each scout, while carrying out the Scouting activities is trained to be
prepared. At their own pace, the scouts discover the virtue of good honest
work whilst enjoying themselves and realizing their true potential.
<br>
<br>Scouting activities include:
<br>
<br>● abseiling
<br>● campcraft
<br>● camping
<br>● canoeing
<br>● community service
<br>● footdrill
<br>● hiking
<br>● orienteering
<br>● outdoor cooking
<br>● pioneering
<br>● rock climbing
<br>
<br>We have won the Frank Cooper Sands Award since 1997 and the Gold Award
since 2003. In 2023, Dragon Scouts were also awarded the Frank Coopers
Sands (Gold with Honours Pennant) for 2022 assessment. This is to recognise
units who have consecutively achieved the Gold category of Frank Cooper
Sands Award for five years. In 2023, there are 8 Dragon Scouts whom achieved
the Chief Commissioner’s Award, the highest award a scout can achieve.</p>
<p>We are also proud to announce that 4 of our Dragon Ventures were awarded
the President’s Scout Award – the highest award presented to youths (Venture
Section) at the Singapore Scout Association.</p>
