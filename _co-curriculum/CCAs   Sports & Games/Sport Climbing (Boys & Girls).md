<p>The Sport Climbing CCA was launched in 2024 as a collaborative initiative
among Cluster South 4 schools, aimed at enriching our students' co-curricular
experiences beyond the traditional CCA offered by our school.</p>
<p>Currently, the team consists of three female and four male Secondary 2
students. They train together with peers from Outram Secondary School and
St. Teresa’s Convent, meeting three times every fortnight at Outram Secondary.
Students from the three schools also bonded through a VIA activity and
an outing in October 2024.</p>
<p>All seven members of our school’s Sport Climbing team took part in the
BFF Verticrux (Highwall Edition) 2024 competition last August. Despite
being young and relatively new to the sport, they achieved commendable
results, securing 6th and 8th place in the Boys’ Individual category and
winning the Overall Champion title for Youth C Boys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February 2025, all team members successfully completed the Singapore
National Climbing Standards (SNCS) Level 1 Course and were awarded their
Level 1 certifications, accredited by the Singapore Sport Climbing and
Mountaineering Federation (SSCMF).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the March holidays, the team also participated in the Inter-Schools
Bouldering Championships organized by Xin Min Secondary School. The Cluster
C Boys came in 6<sup>th</sup> and the C Girls were ranked 9<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Students Leaders from the Cluster schools are working to host
a Workshop for SOTA students on 21 May 2025</p>
