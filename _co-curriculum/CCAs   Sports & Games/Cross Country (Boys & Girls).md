<p><strong>‘The will to win means nothing if you do not have the will to train hard’</strong>
<br>
<br>We prepare students to be physically fit and to acquire technical skills
in track &amp; field events. We hope that students will develop the love
for keeping fit and pursue a lifelong healthy lifestyle. Training includes
distance running, weight training and speed drills.
<br>
<br>In preparation for the National School Games for Cross Country and Track
&amp; Field Championship, in depth techniques for relays are imparted to
students. This is complemented by speed training, endurance training and
distance running.
<br>
<br>Values are paramount in this CCA. We believe the right attitude will turn
students into leaders and athletes into champions. We do not wait for competition
to train; we train to get into competition form. Our focus is on inculcating
the right habits of mind and to invest in the growth of our students. A
student who leaves with a well-rounded development is the pride of the
CCA.
<br>
<br>Over the years, our CCA has been putting in the hard work and has performed
well in the National School Games (NSG) Cross Country Championship. In
2023, the Boys ‘C’ Division Team attained 2nd and the Boys ‘B’ Division
Team attained 8th position overall. In 2023, the Girls ‘C’ and ‘B’ Division
team achieved 19th and 18th position overall’</p>
