<p>The Entrepreneur Club (E-club) was set up in 2004 to promote Innovation
and Enterprise in Gan Eng Seng School. Our vision for E-club is Long life
Learner, Compassionate Innovator. Our mission is to nurture innovators
who dare to try, are eager to learn and who possess the spirit of innovation
and enterprise.
<br>
<br>Through training, E-club aims to create an inclusive society where everyone
regardless of background, profile, readiness and ability is given the opportunity
to create ideas for innovation and imagination. The E-Club also aims to
provide its members with fun-filled, hands-on real life business experience
through continuous innovation and creative approaches. There are three
distinct programmes in the E-Club:
<br>
<br><strong>Edible Gardening</strong>
<br>The club members will learn how to grow crops and maintain the edible
garden. As part of the programme, the club members will learn about budgeting,
marketing, stock taking and setting selling price.
<br>
<br><strong>Upcycling</strong>
<br>The club members will learn handicraft skills. The aim of this upcycling
project is to learn the process of transforming by-product, waste materials,
useless or unwanted products into new products that are perceived to be
better quality.
<br>
<br><strong>Service Learning</strong>
<br>The club members will be engaged in community service, which provide a
pragmatic, progressive learning experience while meeting societal needs.
<br>The following are some of the activities that the Entrepreneur Club participates
in:
<br>
<br><strong>Projects:</strong>
<br>1. Valentines’ Day Sales
<br>2. Teachers’ Day Card
