    <td class="tg-h5mn" colspan="3">Dragon Scouts is the oldest uniformed group in Gan Eng Seng School. Established in 1922, Dragon Scouts has been closely tied to the development of Gan Eng Seng School. Throughout the years of history, Dragon Scouts has produced many successful professionals and has helped to shape the development of Gan Eng Seng School. A good example will be the school colours, red and green which were adopted from the scarf found in Dragon Scouts.<br><br>Scouting is unique because it engages a Scout in a whole range of activities. In pursuit of these activities, the Scout attains various proficiency standards which reinforce positive self-esteem. Furthermore, Scouting allows promising Scouts who set higher standards for themselves to become President’s Scouts, an honour which no other uniformed youth organization can boast of.<br><br>Be Prepared’, the motto of all Scouts, captures the essence of Scouting. Each scout, while carrying out the Scouting activities is trained to be prepared. At their own pace, the scouts discover the virtue of good honest work whilst enjoying themselves and realizing their true potential.<br><br>Scouting activities include:<br><br>●        abseiling<br>●        campcraft<br>●        camping<br>●        canoeing<br>●        community service<br>●        footdrill<br>●        hiking<br>●        orienteering<br>●        outdoor cooking<br>●        pioneering<br>●        rock climbing<br><br>We have won the Frank Cooper Sands Award since 1997 and the Gold Award since 2003.
