*   Service Learning (focusing on Touching Lives, Making a Difference)
*   Outdoor Appreciation (focusing on being at ease with Nature)
*   Healthy Living (focusing on physical and mental wellness)  
      
    

The NYAA Silver award is accorded by the NYAA Council.

Secondary 3 students are offered the opportunity to embark on the NYAA Silver. They commence in January of their Secondary 3 education and can complete the task by June of the following year.  While engaging in the tasks of Service Learning, Outdoor Appreciation and Health Living, Gessians demonstrate and embody our school values of Integrity, Compassion, Discipline, Respect and Resilience.
