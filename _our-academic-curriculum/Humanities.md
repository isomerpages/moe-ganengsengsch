### Vision

Every Gessian – ready for the future

### Mission

To nurture knowledgeable and committed citizens with a global outlook and skills for the future

### About

In line with our mission, the GESS Humanities Department has conceptualised a bespoke Humanities Inquiry process for all Gessians.

We design learning journeys which incorporate specially designed and structured activities that provide students with opportunities to gain first-hand experience of the real world through interactions with people and places. Collaborative assignments and thought-provoking activities that hone 21st Century Competencies (21CC) and Humanities Inquiry Skills are carefully weaved into these learning journeys and events. Through experiential learning, students gain greater insights into the concepts learnt in the classroom. However, due to Covid-19, we had to carry out the Learning Journeys virtually this year. Students’ enthusiasm for learning was not dampened and this episode only served to build up our Core Value of Resilience! Students with a flair for the Humanities may also be selected to represent our school in events like the Geography Challenge, History Challenge or Model United Nations Conference.
