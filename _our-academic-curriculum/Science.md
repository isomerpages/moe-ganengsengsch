### Vision

Gessians with strong foundation and interest in Science

### Mission

To develop Gessians with innate curiosity and critical thinking skills

### About

Our department designs its outreach and talent development programmes to meet the interests of different segments of students. Key outreach programmes include Science Camp and Lower Secondary Applied Learning Programme (ALP) to enthuse, engage, and empower the students to learn science beyond the classroom.

To stretch students’ potential and develop their critical and creative thinking as well as information and communication skills, students prepare for competitions such as New South Wales Science Competition, GreenWave competition, and the Physics Olympiad. The Science Department also conducts the GESS Talents @ RI programme as part of the school’s Capstone Talent Development programme.
