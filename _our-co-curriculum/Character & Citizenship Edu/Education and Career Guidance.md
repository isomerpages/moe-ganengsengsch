**Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) equips Gessians with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to make informed decisions about their education and career pathways. A good ECG curriculum prepares students for successful transition from school to further education or work, as part of their lifelong learning.

The GESS ECG curriculum aims to:

*   nurture student’s self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning;
*   enable students to explore education and career options, by equipping them with accurate and comprehensive information.;
*   help students develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities, and appreciate all occupations across society; and
*   create opportunities for students to build positive connections with the community (such as teachers, ECG counsellors, parents, industry partners), to develop an appreciation for different career pathways.
