<p><strong>Overview</strong>
<br>To harness the transformative potential of technology in education, MOE
has launched the “Transforming Education through Technology” Masterplan
2030 or “EdTech Masterplan 2030” for short, which outlines how schools
can better leverage technology to enhance teaching and learning.
<br>
<br>The EdTech Masterplan 2030 builds on the previous 2020 EdTech Plan and
ICT Masterplans, and addresses the opportunities and challenges of the
post-COVID landscape, where technology has become a critical enabler of
learning
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Nurturing Engaged Future-Ready Learners
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>Together, we harness Technology to enhance teaching and learning in GESS,
to bring up a new generation of responsible and ethical learners</p>
<p><strong>About</strong>
<br>With the firm belief that ICT should be part of quality teaching and learning,
the ICT department takes the initiative to collaborate with all departments
to design and enact an ICT-enriched curriculum in GESS.</p>
<p>A landmark programme under the ICT department’s charge continues to be
the rollout of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP). Since
its onset in 2021, the department has taken care of it every step of the
way – from device procurement, to distribution, to routine maintenance.</p>
<p>Under the ICT Department also takes charge in organising the the yearly
Code For Fun enrichment programme that aims to promote computational thinking
among the Secondary 1s.</p>

<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (<strong>“NDLP”</strong>) for our schools and
Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital
literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the
Personalised Digital Learning Programme (<strong>“PDLP”</strong>) which
places in the hands of secondary school students, a school-prescribed Personal
Learning Device (<strong>“PLD”</strong>) by end-2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform –
the Singapore Student Learning Space (<strong>“SLS”</strong>) – as well
as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning.
This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these
skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.&nbsp;</p>
