### **Personalised Digital Literacy Programme (PDLP)**

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (**“NDLP”**) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (**“PDLP”**) which places in the hands of secondary school students, a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (**“PLD”**) by end-2021.&nbsp;

  

The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (**“SLS”**) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.&nbsp;

  

For more information on PDLP Journey in Gan Eng Seng School, please refer to the following website :&nbsp;

### **Vision**

Technology – A Way of Life in GESS

### **Mission**

Together, we harness Technology to enhance teaching and learning in GESS, to bring up a new generation of responsible and ethical learners
### **About**

With the firm belief that ICT should be part of quality teaching and learning, the Technology department takes the initiative to collaborate with all departments to design and enact an ICT-enriched curriculum in GESS.

A landmark programme under the ICT department’s charge continues to be the rollout of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP). Since its onset in 2021, the department has taken care of it every step of the way – from device procurement, to distribution, to routine maintenance.

Under the ICT Department also takes charge in organising the the yearly Code For Fun enrichment programme that aims to promote computational thinking among the Secondary 1s.

**Points to Note:**
<br>
1.	Parents should report the loss of the device to the police **immediately** upon confirmation, unless they are uncertain whether it was left in school and need to check first.
2.	**Concurrently**, they should inform the school through the ICT helpdesk at gess_it_helpdesk@moe.edu.sg or approach Mr. Soh. The school will lock their device.
3.	Please inform the ICT Department if a temporary device is required. This depends on the parents/students, as some students may have another device at home.
4.	After making a police report, parents should email the insurer to inform them about the loss of the device and provide the police report. The insurer will reply to confirm whether their insurance claim is successful or not. This should be done immediately after making the police report.
5.	Parents should decide whether to purchase a new device and inform gess_it_helpdesk@moe.edu.sg or contact me (Mdm Siti). This should be done after they receive a response from the insurer.
6.	For any matters regarding finance, parents may approach Ms. Ong Lay Peng at ong_lay_peng@schools.gov.sg. This should be done once parents decide to purchase but would like to know more about the financial aspects.
7.	A hardcopy form will be given to parents through the student if they would like to purchase a new device through the school. This should be done once parents decide to purchase.
8.	Upon receiving the form from parents, the ICT Department (Mdm Siti) will proceed with the purchase of the device. This should be done after receiving the hardcopy form from parents.
9.	Students will receive the device once AsiaPac delivers them to the school. This should be done once the school receives the devices from AsiaPac.
