<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Gessians with strong foundation and interest in Science</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To develop Gessians with innate curiosity and critical thinking skills</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Our department designs its outreach and talent development programmes
to meet the interests of different segments of students. Key outreach programmes
include Science Camp and Lower Secondary Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
to enthuse, engage, and empower the students to learn science beyond the
classroom.</p>
<p>To stretch students’ potential and develop their critical and creative
thinking as well as information and communication skills, students prepare
for competitions such as New South Wales Science Competition, GreenWave
competition, and the Physics Olympiad. The Science Department also conducts
the GESS Talents @ RI programme as part of the school’s Capstone Talent
Development programme.</p>
