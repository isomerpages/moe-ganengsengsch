To enrich the learning experiences and promote multi-cultural literacy, a number of programmes are organised throughout the year. These include Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, and Deepavali Celebrations, as well as the Conversational Chinese/Malay Language Programme. Students are also exposed to a wide range of activities during the Mother Tongue Fortnight.</p><p>To develop talents and level up studentsâ€™ Mother Tongue proficiency, the department also trains and sends students to participate in external competitions. The department also collaborates with Gan Clan through cultural activities and training workshops to enable students to serve as Student Tour Guide at Gan Heritage Centre. This has further strengthened our partnership and encourage our youths to involve with community services in promoting cultural heritage of Singapore.</p>
