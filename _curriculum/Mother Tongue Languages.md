<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Gessians are Effective Communicators of Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To develop Gessians who have lifelong interest in learning their Mother
Tongue, and who are rooted to their ethnic culture.</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages department nurtures active learners who can
use their Mother Tongue proficiently and are rooted to their cultures.</p>
<p>We create a vibrant learning culture through quality curriculum and sound
pedagogies. To enrich the learning experiences and promote multi-cultural
literacy, a number of programmes are organised throughout the year. These
include Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, and Deepavali Celebrations, as well
as the Conversational Chinese/Malay Language Programme. Students are also
exposed to a wide range of activities during the Mother Tongue Fortnight.</p>
<p>To develop talents and level up students’ Mother Tongue proficiency, the
department also trains and sends students to participate in external competitions.
The department also collaborates with Gan Clan through cultural activities
and training workshops to enable students to serve as Student Tour Guide
at Gan Heritage Centre. This has further strengthened our partnership and
encourage our youths to involve with community services in promoting cultural
heritage of Singapore.</p>
