The Design and Technology (D&T) department in GESS nurtures our students to be able to embrace complexities, and develop critical and creative thinking skills. This is all done via various design-and-make activities in its curriculum.

Our lessons provide opportunities for students to be sensitive to the needs, and desires, of ordinary people in their daily lives. Students practice divergent and convergent thinking through formulating mock-ups of ideas designed to address real-world issues. They will then construct prototypes in the workshop with various materials.

There are particular focus areas unique to each year of study, as follows:

*   Secondary 1: Key tag + Tealight holder
*   Secondary 2: Clamp+
*   Upper Secondary: Theme â€“ Combining
