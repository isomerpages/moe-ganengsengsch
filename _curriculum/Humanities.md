<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Every Gessian – ready for the future</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To nurture knowledgeable and committed citizens with a global outlook
and skills for the future</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>In line with our mission, the GESS Humanities Department has conceptualised
a Humanities Inquiry process for all Gessians.</p>
<p>We design learning journeys which incorporate specially designed and structured
activities that provide students with opportunities to gain first-hand
experience of the real world through interactions with people and places.
Collaborative assignments and thought-provoking activities that hone 21st
Century Competencies (21CC) and Humanities Inquiry Skills are carefully
weaved into these experiences. Through experiential learning, students
gain greater insights into the concepts learnt in the classroom.</p>
<p>Students with a flair for the Humanities may also be selected to represent
our school in events like the Geography Challenge, History Challenge or
Model United Nations Conference under our school’s Capstone Programme.</p>
