<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>To promote and support a comprehensive, innovative and vibrant learning
environment where Gessians are engaged and become confident problem solvers</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To enable Gessians to build a strong foundation in Mathematics, and develop
a passion for Mathematics and apply what they have learnt in everyday life.</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>The key guiding philosophy of the Mathematics Department’s total curriculum
is the Appreciation of, and Achievement, in Mathematics.</p>
<p>Our team designs learning experiences which serve the dual purpose of
teaching the mathematical skills, concepts and processes while simultaneously
teaching the 21st century competencies into our curriculum. An example
would be through our Anchor Tasks. Peer tutoring in Mathematics after curriculum
lessons also helps promote cooperative learning, student self-directedness,
and ownership of learning.</p>
<p>The department strives to achieve its vision as our teachers continue
to adopt suitable e-pedagogies and harness the affordances of students’
Personal Learning Devices.</p>
<p>Our Talent Development Programme, in line with the school’s broader Capstone
Programme, provides opportunities for high-performing students to attend
Math Olympiad training programme, leading to participation in the Singapore
Mathematics Olympiad (SMO) competition. During the SMO, students learn
advanced mathematical concepts and develop creative mathematical thinking
and problem solving skills.</p>
