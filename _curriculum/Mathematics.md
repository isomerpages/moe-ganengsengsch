### Vision

To promote and support a comprehensive, innovative and vibrant learning environment where Gessians are engaged and become confident problem solvers

### Mission

To enable Gessians to build a strong foundation in Mathematics, and develop a passion for Mathematics and apply what they have learnt in everyday life.

### About

The key guiding philosophy of the Mathematics Department’s total curriculum is the Appreciation of, and Achievement, in Mathematics.

Our team designs learning experiences which serve the dual purpose of teaching the mathematical skills, concepts and processes while simultaneously teaching the 21st century competencies into our curriculum. An example would be through our Anchor Tasks. Peer tutoring in Mathematics after curriculum lessons also helps promote cooperative learning, student self-directedness, and ownership of learning.

The department strives to achieve its vision as our teachers continue to adopt suitable e-pedagogies and harness the affordances of students’ Personal Learning Devices.

Our Talent Development Programme, in line with the school’s broader Capstone Programme, provides opportunities for high-performing students to attend Math Olympiad training programme, leading to participation in the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad (SMO) competition. During the SMO, students learn advanced mathematical concepts and develop creative mathematical thinking and problem solving skills.
