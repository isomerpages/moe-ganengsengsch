We also empower our Sport Leaders to organise games for students on Sports Wednesday.&nbsp; The display of our school values like discipline, resilience and respect are evident when our students partake in these healthy lifestyle activities.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Picture1.jpeg"></div><p></p>
