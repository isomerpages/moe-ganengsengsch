Gan Eng Seng School’s STEM Applied Learning Programme (STEM-ALP) shares the same vision in preparing Gessians to be future-ready. Titled **Probes\***, GESS educators strive to instill the thirst for knowledge fuelled by the curiosity in our learners’ minds. This is achieved by immersing Gessians in engaging lessons designed by the teachers which bring out meaningful synthesis and application of concepts learnt in the classroom.

Through this ALP, our Gessians will be taught to:

1)   broaden their knowledge base in the STEM areas by **<u><em>probing further</em></u>**,

2)   learn with real-life contexts by **<u><em>probing deeper</em></u>**, and

3)   challenge assumptions and norms by **<u><em>probing harder</em></u>**.

In **Probes\***, the school focuses on two key domains in which we commit our efforts towards preparing a holistic GESS learning experience. These two domains are Sustainability and Digitalisation and Coding.

*   **_Sustainability_**: In the domain of sustainability, Gessians are exposed to current global challenges like climate change and food security to enhance their world-view. To grow their competencies in ideation and conceptualisation of solutions, Gessians work in groups on tasks such as designing a water purifying process or learn to tend for plants in the edible gardens.

*   **_Digitalisation and Coding_**: In response to the quickly evolving nature of the sphere of digital technology, a rudimentary knowledge of coding and associated logics will be essential to navigate the changes which will arise. Hence, in partnership with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), our Sec 1 Gessians go through a Tier 1 coding programme known as Code for Fun (CFF). In this programme, they were exposed from learning how to code using Micro:Bit controllers to Artificial Intelligence. At the end of this programme, Gessians are to draw from what they learnt and design a smart solution to a real-world problem given by the instructors.

*   **Design Thinking**: The Design Thinking process (Empathise – Define – Ideate – Prototype – Test) is an iterative methodology for creative problem-solving. It is used as the overarching approach in our ALP domains. Design thinking is applied in Alternative Assessments (AA) and class projects, allowing Gessians to come together in teams to solve real-world tasks. Through this approach, Gessians exercise creativity by synthesizing their knowledge and demonstrate teamwork beyond the normal pen-and-paper learning experience.

The ALP experience is further enriched by curated webinars organised by external agencies such as DSTA and Science Centre where expert speakers are invited to share the current technology development from time to time. Gessians who demonstrate potential and passion are also selected to represent the school in various competitions organised by the other agencies and institutes of education such as Polytechnics or other secondary schools under the Tier 2 programme.
