# **Nurturing e21st Century Competencies**
# 
# **at Gan Eng Seng School**

At Gan Eng Seng School, we are committed to nurturing students who are not only academically prepared but also equipped with the values, skills and dispositions they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving world.

Central to this commitment is our whole-school emphasis on developing Emerging 21st Century Competencies (e21CC). We believe that education is a journey of discovery, growth and empowerment, and e21CC provides the essential framework through which our students build confidence, think critically, collaborate effectively, communicate with purpose and navigate challenges with resilience.

Our aims are clear: to develop every Gessian to be a Principled Leader, Reflective and Innovative Thinker, Engaged Learner and Active Citizen. To achieve this, we have designed a holistic approach that deliberately integrates e21CC across all aspects of school life—from classroom learning to co-curricular activities, student leadership opportunities to key student development experiences. This ensures that the core competencies of civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills; critical and inventive thinking; and communication, collaboration and information skills are not merely taught but authentically lived and practised daily.

Through this integrated e21CC approach, we empower Gessians to become confident individuals who embrace lifelong learning, self-directed learners who take ownership of their growth, active contributors who make a positive difference in their communities, and concerned citizens who are rooted in values and committed to serving Singapore and the world.

**A Whole-School Approach to 21CC Development**

e21CC at GESS is intentionally woven into the school’s Total Curriculum. Whether students are learning Mathematics, exploring the Humanities, engaging in the Arts, participating in Co-Curricular Activities, or deepening their character through CCE, every experience is designed to nurture the competencies and mindsets essential for success in school and beyond.




# **Our signature programmes play a key role in bringing e21CC to life:**

**1\. GESS Camps: Learning Through Outdoor**

Our annual GESS Camps provide authentic opportunities for students to step outside their comfort zones and develop resilience, teamwork, and leadership. Through outdoor learning and challenge-based activities, students learn to persevere, make responsible decisions, and collaborate. Every activity is carefully aligned with e21CC outcomes to ensure meaningful and sustained growth.



  

Managing emotions in challenging or unfamiliar situations, showing empathy and support to struggling peers

**2\. GESS CARES: Serving with Heart and Purpose**

Through our Values-in-Action (VIA) programme, students engage in thoughtful service grounded in empathy and problem-solving. Using design thinking approach, students identify real community needs, co-create solutions, and reflect on the impact of their actions. This process develops communication, collaboration, creativity, and social awareness—key competencies that shape Gessians into compassionate contributors to society.



Understanding responsibilities towards vulnerable members of society and demonstrating active citizenship through service

Through partnerships and exchanges with schools in Thailand, Brunei, Guangzhou and other global cities, students learn to appreciate diverse cultures, understand global issues, and build friendships across borders

Understanding global issues, international perspectives and interconnectedness between nations

**4\. Beyond Programmes: Nurturing Competencies Every Day**

What makes our approach to e21CC distinctive is the way it is embedded into the everyday experiences of our students and teachers:

Student Voice and Agency and platforms such as Hi5 and Take5 at assemblies empower students to lead, present ideas, and build confidence in expressing themselves.


  



**5\. Communication and Oracy Development**

Through oracy workshops, class discussions, and alternative assessments, students learn to articulate their thoughts clearly, confidently, and purposefully.



  

Articulating ideas clearly and confidently to large audiences, using appropriate tone and body language

**6\.** **E21CC and Staff Development**

Teachers at GESS engage in open classrooms, professional learning teams, and continual professional development. Through collaborative learning and reflective dialogue, teachers enhance the design of learning experiences that engage students and develop e21CC.



  

Lesson design and sharing at PLTs &amp; Open classrooms

Our students' energy, creativity and compassion inspire us daily. As a community, we walk this journey alongside them—supporting their aspirations, nurturing their strengths and celebrating their growth. We believe that developing&nbsp; e21CC is not a separate curriculum but a shared responsibility woven into every interaction, lesson and experience. It requires thoughtful design, caring relationships and purposeful opportunities for students to apply and deepen these essential competencies.
