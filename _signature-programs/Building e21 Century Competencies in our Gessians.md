<h4><strong>Nurturing e21st Century Competencies at Gan Eng Seng School</strong></h4>
<p>At Gan Eng Seng School, we are committed to nurturing students who are
not only academically prepared but also equipped with the values, skills
and dispositions they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving world.</p>
<p>Central to this commitment is our whole-school emphasis on developing
Emerging 21st Century Competencies (e21CC). We believe that education is
a journey of discovery, growth and empowerment, and e21CC provides the
essential framework through which our students build confidence, think
critically, collaborate effectively, communicate with purpose and navigate
challenges with resilience.</p>
<p>Our aims are clear: to develop every Gessian to be a Principled Leader,
Reflective and Innovative Thinker, Engaged Learner and Active Citizen.
To achieve this, we have designed a holistic approach that deliberately
integrates e21CC across all aspects of school life—from classroom learning
to co-curricular activities, student leadership opportunities to key student
development experiences. This ensures that the core competencies of civic
literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills; critical and inventive
thinking; and communication, collaboration and information skills are not
merely taught but authentically lived and practised daily.</p>
<p>Through this integrated e21CC approach, we empower Gessians to become
confident individuals who embrace lifelong learning, self-directed learners
who take ownership of their growth, active contributors who make a positive
difference in their communities, and concerned citizens who are rooted
in values and committed to serving Singapore and the world.</p>

<p><strong>A Whole-School Approach to 21CC Development</strong>
</p>
<p>e21CC at GESS is intentionally woven into the school’s Total Curriculum.
Whether students are learning Mathematics, exploring the Humanities, engaging
in the Arts, participating in Co-Curricular Activities, or deepening their
character through CCE, every experience is designed to nurture the competencies
and mindsets essential for success in school and beyond.</p>

<h4><strong>Our signature programmes play a key role in bringing e21CC to life:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1. GESS Camps: Learning Through Outdoor</strong>
</p>
<p>Our annual GESS Camps provide authentic opportunities for students to
step outside their comfort zones and develop resilience, teamwork, and
leadership. Through outdoor learning and challenge-based activities, students
learn to persevere, make responsible decisions, and collaborate. Every
activity is carefully aligned with e21CC outcomes to ensure meaningful
and sustained growth.</p>

<p><strong>2. GESS CARES: Serving with Heart and Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>Through our Values-in-Action (VIA) programme, students engage in thoughtful
service grounded in empathy and problem-solving. Using design thinking
approach, students identify real community needs, co-create solutions,
and reflect on the impact of their actions. This process develops communication,
collaboration, creativity, and social awareness—key competencies that shape
Gessians into compassionate contributors to society.</p>
<p>Understanding responsibilities towards vulnerable members of society and
demonstrating active citizenship through service</p>
<p><strong>3. Global Connections: Expanding Horizons</strong>
</p>

internationalisation programme broadens students’ perspectives and builds
cross-cultural awareness. Through partnerships and exchanges with schools
in Thailand, Brunei, Guangzhou and other global cities, students learn
to appreciate diverse cultures, understand global issues, and build friendships
across borders</p>
<p>Understanding global issues, international perspectives and interconnectedness
between nations</p>
<p><strong>4. Beyond Programmes: Nurturing Competencies Every Day</strong>
</p>
<p>What makes our approach to e21CC distinctive is the way it is embedded
into the everyday experiences of our students and teachers:</p>
<p>Student Voice and Agency and platforms such as Hi5 and Take5 at assemblies
empower students to lead, present ideas, and build confidence in expressing
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>5. Communication and Oracy Development</strong>
</p>
<p>Through oracy workshops, class discussions, and alternative assessments,
students learn to articulate their thoughts clearly, confidently, and purposefully.</p>
<p>Articulating ideas clearly and confidently to large audiences, using appropriate
tone and body language</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong>  <strong>E21CC and Staff Development</strong>
</p>
<p>Teachers at GESS engage in open classrooms, professional learning teams,
and continual professional development. Through collaborative learning
and reflective dialogue, teachers enhance the design of learning experiences
that engage students and develop e21CC.</p>
<p>Lesson design and sharing at PLTs &amp; Open classrooms</p>
<p>Our students' energy, creativity and compassion inspire us daily. As a
community, we walk this journey alongside them—supporting their aspirations,
nurturing their strengths and celebrating their growth. We believe that
developing&nbsp; e21CC is not a separate curriculum but a shared responsibility
woven into every interaction, lesson and experience. It requires thoughtful
design, caring relationships and purposeful opportunities for students
to apply and deepen these essential competencies.</p>
<p>For Gessians of Excellence, Standing and Significance!</p>
