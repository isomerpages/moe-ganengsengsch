#### **Capstone@GESS**

Here at GESS, we seek to develop Gessians of Excellence, Standing and Significance. Capstone@GESS is the Talent Development Programme which is customised for selected students who show strong aptitude, interest and motivation in the cognitive domain. Curated programmes are tailored to provide opportunities for students to learn beyond their classrooms, and to strengthen some of the 21st Century Competencies. Capstone@GESS comprises two tiers. 

**Capstone Tier 1** caters to students identified for specific department-based stretch programmes anchored on their interests and aptitude. Opportunities are provided for them to participate in a wide array of competitions and seminars to deepen their learning in various academic disciplines. Some opportunities include: 
* Science: International Competition and Assessment for Science; Biology, Chemistry and Physics Olympiad 
* Mathematics: Singapore Mathematics Olympiad 
* English Language: Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition; Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championship; YMCA PESA 
* Mother Tongue Languages: Bilingual Youth Model United Nations 
* Humanities: Model United Nations, History Challenge, Geography Challenge 

**Capstone Tier 2, also known as Capstone+**, targets the overall top 10% of each cohort at the school level. These selected students go through a specially curated broad-based programme over the four years in GESS. Our collaboration with various institutions and organisations provides opportunities for these students to attend workshops and learning journeys eg on AI and design thinking. Teacher designed workshop on elevator pitch and use of generative AI helped equip students with the necessary skills for project management and presentation. Students work collaboratively in groups and apply the design thinking process to propose solutions for authentic issues eg in the different domains of sustainability, aging population, public health, mental health and cybersecurity. Students will then present their learning during learning festival and assembly.

Through the Capstone+ Programme, we hope for our students to strengthen their 21st Century Competencies: Civic, Global and Cross-Cultural Literacy; Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking as well as Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills.
