#### **Capstone@GESS**

Here at GESS, we seek to develop Gessians of Excellence, Standing and Significance. Capstone@GESS is the Talent Development Programme which is customised for selected students who show strong aptitude, interest and motivation in the cognitive domain. Curated programmes are tailored to provide opportunities for students to learn beyond their classrooms, and to grow into reflective and innovative thinkers, as well as skillful communicators. Capstone@GESS comprises two tiers.

At the end of each year, the school provides opportunities for students who have shown strong aptitude, interest and motivation to join the programme in the following year. This decision is informed by the students’ overall academic results as well as recommendation and endorsement from the form teachers and subject teachers.

**Capstone Tier 1** caters to students identified for specific department-based stretch programmes anchored on their passion and aptitude. Opportunities are provided for them to participate in a wide array of competitions and seminars to deepen their learning in various academic disciplines. Some opportunities include the Model United Nations, Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championship and the International Competition and Assessment for Science.

**Capstone Tier 2**, **also known as Capstone+,** targets the overall top 10% of each cohort at the school level. These selected students go through a specially curated broad-based programme over the four years in GESS. Our collaboration with Raffles Institution (RI) provides opportunities for these students to attend workshops and research congresses. Our partnership with our overseas partners also provides students with opportunities to engage their counterparts on global issues, developing them to become responsible global citizens.

The Capstone+ Framework is a progressive model based on the approach of Enrich, Enthuse, Engage and Empower anchored on the theme of sustainability.

*   At the **Secondary 1** level, students _enrich_ their learning on the theme of sustainability through self-directed learning to understand and deepen their understanding about the Water Story and other facets on the theme of sustainability. They also attend a presentation on sustainability by their seniors to enrich their learning.
*   At the **Secondary 2** level, students are _enthused_ through the application of design thinking (Empathise, Define, Ideate and Prototype) to propose solutions to real world problems anchored on the theme of sustainability. Fortnightly mentoring sessions by teachers are provided to sharpen students’ scientific and critical thinking while going through the design thinking process. The students will then have an opportunity to showcase their projects at various platforms: at the school level, RI Research Forum and exchange programmes with partnering schools in Bangkok and Brunei. Students will be enthused as they exchange ideas and develop their project proposals and solutions.
*   At the **Secondary 3** level, students will be _engaged_ through the process of refining their projects for showcase at various platforms: at the school level, RI Research Forum and exchange programmes with partnering schools in Bangkok and Brunei. This iterative process is done through constant engagement with practitioners as well as input from the teacher mentors and seniors.
*   At the **Secondary 4** level, students will be _empowered_ to mentor and coach their juniors in their projects to pass on their knowledge that they have gained.
