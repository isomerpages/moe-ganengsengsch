Gan Eng Seng School’s STEM Applied Learning Programme (STEM-ALP) shares the same vision in preparing Gessians to be future-ready. Titled **Probes\***, GESS educators strive to instill the thirst for knowledge fuelled by the curiosity in our learners’ minds. This is achieved by immersing Gessians in engaging lessons designed by the teachers which bring out meaningful synthesis and application of concepts learnt in the classroom.

Through this ALP, our Gessians will be taught to:

1)   broaden their knowledge base in the STEM areas by **<u>_probing further_</u>**,

2)   learn with real-life contexts by **<u>_probing deeper_</u>**, and

3)   challenge assumptions and norms by **<u>_probing harder_</u>**.

In **Probes\***, the school focuses on two key domains in which we commit our efforts towards preparing a holistic GESS learning experience. These two domains are Sustainability and Digitalisation and Coding.

*   **_Sustainability_**: In the domain of sustainability, Gessians are exposed to current global challenges like climate change and food security to enhance their world-view. To grow their competencies in ideation and conceptualisation of solutions, Gessians work in groups on tasks such as designing a water purifying process or learn to tend for plants in the edible gardens.
