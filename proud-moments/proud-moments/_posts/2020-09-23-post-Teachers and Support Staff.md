It was a day of gratitude for the unsung heroes in GESS. Gessians expressed appreciation for the hard work and dedications of the Teachers and Support Staff on 3 Sept 2020. Many staff also received special awards such as the MOE Long service awards and the GESS Long service awards. Joining us for the celebrations was Mr Heng, our SAC Chairperson

Glow and Grow, Appreciation We Show – is the theme for this year’s Teachers’ and Support Staff Celebration. We would like to recognise and thank our teachers and support staff who have worked hard so that school can resume normalcy despite the Covid-19 situation. We had a special celebration where we recognised our support staff,a live award ceremony for our teachers and a live kahoot game that all staff and students could join in. Though we could not gather in a mass setting to celebrate as before,the hearts to thank and appreciate our teachers and support staff have never changed.

Happy Teachers’ and Support Staff Day once again!
