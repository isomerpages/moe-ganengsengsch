It gives us joy to inform you that a Gessian was featured on The Straits Times on 7th Nov 2019. The Boys’ Brigade Share-a-Gift is a charity project that will reach out to more than 40,000 beneficiaries this year. At a media conference held at the Boys’ Brigade HQ on 6th November to launch the event, ten Gessians from the 50th Boys’ Brigade Company were invited to participate and assist in the event. When asked about their experience, the Gessians were enthusiastic, and said they had an interesting and meaningful time being of service to others. They also looked forward to helping out at the actual BB Share-a-Gift event.
