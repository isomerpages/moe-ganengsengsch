GESS Celebrates!

Last year, the Malay Language Council of Singapore appointed two of our students, Amirah from 4A and Haqqan from 4B as Rakan Bahasa or Friends of Bahasa. As part of their commitment, they carried out their duties during the launch of Malay Language Month and led a team in organising Aroozoo Reads Hari Raya Special Edition.

This year, on 13 April 2019, Ilhan from 3B and Lulu from 3H were appointed as Rakan Bahasa or Friends of Bahasa.
