In June this year, 57 Upper Secondary Gessians participated in the Advanced Elective Modules organised by Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The programme was not only a good platform for students to learn practical and authentic skills but also to find out about the learning experiences in a polytechnic. We are happy to announce that all of them completed the course successfully with commendable results.

The three AEMs the students took were

(1) Let Your Dreams Take Flight,

(2) Mechanical Design and 3D Printing and

(3) Connecting Trade and Business with Logistics.
