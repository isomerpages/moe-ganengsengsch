Congratulations to the 50th Company for their sustained achievement of the JMF Gold Award for the 2019 assessment year! Some of the notable achievements that culminated in the JMF Gold were the results of the boys’ hard work in the BB Blaze 2019 (Gold Honour Roll), BB Character Quest 2019 (1st runner up) and organising a BB Cares ViA programme in 2019.

In addition, Dennis Foo from 4H and Aidan Boey from 4C have also attained the Founder’s Award 2020, the highest achievement for BB boys in the Seniors Programme. Dennis Foo was also awarded the Best Boy Award 2020.
