GESS celebrated our nation’s 55th birthday and the school’s Founder’s Day in a different way. While observing all safety management measures, we tapped on online platforms to bring the Singapore spirit to the classrooms. With the combined efforts of the NE committee headed by Ms Jenny Ngoh, Mr Paul Lee and Mr Tay and supported by all staff, we aimed to instil in our students confidence in our nation and future! GESS thanks all partners and patrons for sponsoring the student awards. Onward Singapore!
