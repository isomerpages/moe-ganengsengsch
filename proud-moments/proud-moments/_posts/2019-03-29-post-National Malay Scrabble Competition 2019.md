4 of our Secondary 3N(A) Malay students represented GESS in the National Malay Scrabble Competition 2019 (Zonal â€“ South), alongside 10 other schools. They are Chloe (3B), Rusydee (3B), Syafiqah (3B) and Khairul (3C). We are pleased to announce that we have emerged as the 1st Runner-Up overall.

With that, we have also qualified for the Nationals, alongside 11 other schools from the various zones, which will be held on the 27th of April at Catholic Junior College.

Wishing our students all the best for the next level of competition!

Onward Gessians.
