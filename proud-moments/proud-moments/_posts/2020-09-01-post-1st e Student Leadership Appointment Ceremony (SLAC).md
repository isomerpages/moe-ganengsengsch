GESS had its 1st e-Student Leadership Appointment Ceremony (SLAC) in Term 3 Week 8 to officially appoint and affirm our incoming Student Leaders.

The theme for this year’s ceremony is “Glow and Grow, Bravery We Show”.

We are constantly faced with uncertainties and challenges in our daily lives. The Covid-19 situation definitely has helped us to see things in a different light. As such, this will also be our first time that we are appointing our Student Leaders in a different way.

Our Student Leaders will rise up to the theme where they will Grow and Glow as leaders by taking on new responsibilities, gaining new experiences, and showing bravery in the face of adversity.

The school would like to extend our sincere appreciation to all seniors for their dedicated work as student leaders and look forward to the next group of student leaders to glow and grow!

Thank you Student Leaders for your service and commitment to the school.
