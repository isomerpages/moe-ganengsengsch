Congratulations to Hodges Demi-Lyn Tabiano of Class 3H! She was awarded the Consolation Prize in the Poster (Secondary) Category in the Safety Starts with Me Competition 2020, organised by Workplace Safety and Health Council.

Do take some time to view her poster design and read about her safety message behind her design.
