Dear Parents/Guardians,

As schools move into Full Home-Based Learning (HBL) from 19 May to 28 May, how can you support your child during this time?

This issue of Parent Kit ‘Supporting Your Child During Full Home-Based Learning’ provides practical tips on how you can support your child to learn independently and to be meaningfully engaged in the next two weeks. This is also an opportunity for you to understand your child better, strengthen your bonds with him/her and look after each other’s well-being.

Have fun as you keep learning, and stay safe! You’ve got this!
