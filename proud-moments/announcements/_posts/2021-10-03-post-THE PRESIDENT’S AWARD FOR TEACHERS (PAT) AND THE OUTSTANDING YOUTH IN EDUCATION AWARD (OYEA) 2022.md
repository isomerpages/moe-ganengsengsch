Dear Parents/Guardians,

Every year, two national awards are given out to teachers in Singapore to recognise their professional excellence. They are the President’s Award for Teachers (PAT) and the Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA). We would like to invite parents and students to nominate teachers who truly deserve these recognitions. Please read attached letter for more details on how to nominate.

Thank you
