Dear Parents

To better manage the Coronavirus situation, GESS has implemented the following precautionary measures:

1.  There are only be 2 entry points into the school – the front gate (from 6:30am), and the back gate facing Tiong Bahru Park (from 7:00am). This is to better control the traffic flow into school.
2.  There are staff members stationed at both entry points to conduct visual checks on the students’ well-being every morning. Students who are wearing surgical masks, or who appear unwell (sneezing, coughing) will be asked to report to the Screening Station for temperature-taking.
3.  There is a temperature-taking exercise in the classrooms every morning after flag-raising. Students with a temperature of 38oC or more will be sent to the Screening Station for rest and another reading of the thermometer. If his/her temperature remains at 38oC or higher, we will contact a parent/guardian to bring the child to the doctor.
4.  There are fixed classroom seating plans for every lesson. This is to ensure ease of contact tracing, should the need arise.

The school has addressed the students on several occasions regarding the measures above, as well as precautionary measures they should take. Please remind your children/ward to be mindful of personal hygiene, and to wash their hands with soap thoroughly and regularly. We also want to inculcate in them the value of social responsibility, and that they should see a doctor if they are unwell, and stay at home if they are given a MC. Meanwhile, lessons and other activities will continue as planned, but rest assured that we will monitor the situation closely and take the necessary measures if the situation calls for it.
