Dear parents/guardians,

The school has been informed by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) that 8 Lower Delta Road which was previously used by the Singapore Examination and Assessment Board, will be temporarily converted to house healthy foreign workers. This is part of the whole-of-government effort to combat the spread of Covid-19 in Singapore. School leaders, together with the Operations Manager, have met SLA and MOE officials to put in place safety and security plans that would ensure the well-being of all staff and students. The workers are required to stay within the premises at all times with controlled access and security measures such as CCTVs and security officers on patrol within the compound. Barriers are also erected to reduce visibility of activities at the facility. Workers will start moving into the facility in June 2020.

Let us uphold the vision of our Founder to always lend a helping hand to those in need. Should you have any queries regarding the above, you may write in to lowerdelta.dorm@gmail.com. For further information, read attached FAQs from SLA.
