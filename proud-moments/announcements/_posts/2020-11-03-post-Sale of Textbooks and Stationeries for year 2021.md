Dear parents/guardians,

**Sale of Textbooks/Stationeries for year 2021**

Please be informed that there will be no physical sale of textbooks/stationeries in the school premises this year due to Covid-19. You can purchase your child’s/ward’s textbooks and other related items online at [pacificbookstores.com](http://pacificbookstores.com/) with options for home delivery (Fixed delivery Charge of $11.80 applies) or self-collection in school premises. The online ordering system will be available from 4 Nov 2020 to 31 Dec 2020 through the Pacific Bookstores Website.

If you opt for self-collection, you will have to choose a date and time (1st session 9-12pm / 2nd session 12-3pm) to do so. Only a maximum of 35 persons per session would be allowed to come into the school to do the self-collection.  There will be no self-collection on weekends and Public Holidays.

MOE FAS students will have to come personally to collect the booklist and an authorization letter from General Office before proceeding to the school bookshop to collect their textbooks/stationeries. The onsite collection dates are listed on the school website [here](/school-information/school-bookshop-and-booklists/).

All booklists except Sec 1 booklists are available on our school website. Please click [here](/school-information/school-bookshop-and-booklists/) to see the booklists. The booklist for sec 1 will only be available by end Nov 2020.
