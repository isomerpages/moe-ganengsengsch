Dear parents,

As school re-opens on 29 Jan 2020, MOE will be enhancing precautionary measures in view of the novel coronavirus situation. These include daily temperature taking and Leave of Absence for students and staff with a travel history to China. More details are in the attached letter to parents.

Let us all play our part in keeping good personal hygiene and taking social responsibility. There may be some inconveniences as preventive steps are taken, but together we can keep our children safe while minimizing disruption to learning.

Thank you. <br>
Ms Tan Hwee Pin <br>
Principal
