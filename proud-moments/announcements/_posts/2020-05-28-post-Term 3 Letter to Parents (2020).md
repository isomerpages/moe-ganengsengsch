Dear Parents/Guardians,

With the end of the Circuit Breaker period on 1 June 2020, we will progressively bring students back to school from 2 June 2020 (Term 3), in a careful and safe manner. Please read the attached letter for information on school re-opening and the safety measures put in place to make school a safe place for teaching and learning.

Thank you
