Dear parents/guardians,

Wishing all our Chinese parents, guardians and students a Happy and a Prosperous Chinese New Year!

**School Emergency Preparedness Exercise**

Please be informed that our school will be conducting an evacuation and a lockdown drill as part of an Emergency Preparedness Exercise on 5 March 2019. This exercise aims to train our staff and students to be prepared for any emergency in the school premises and to be familiar with the safety and evacuation procedures. We will conduct the exercise anytime between 8 am and 1 pm, hence, kindly refrain from driving into our school during this period. If you have queries or need clarification, please contact Mr Phoon (Admin Manager) at 64745594.
