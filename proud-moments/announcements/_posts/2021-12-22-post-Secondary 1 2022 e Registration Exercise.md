On behalf of all staff and students, we welcome you and your child to our Gessian family! Your child is now part of a well-established school that has, for more than 135 years, produced Gessians of Excellence, Standing and Significance.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, we are unable to meet you face-to-face this year. Hence, we will be uploading all the relevant information for the Secondary 1 (2022) e-Registration on this website at 8am on 23rd December 2021.

To share with you some of the key information about the school as well as administrative matters pertaining to the registration process, we will be conducting a zoom webinar at 8.30 am on 23rd December 2021. Details of the webinar will be sent via the Parents Gateway by the end of today.

Thank you.
