GESS Founder’s Day 2022 with the theme of Grateful hearts and Gracious hands went on very well on 11 March 2022. Our Guest-Of-Honour was Colonel Cheak (class of 1991).  Following, SMM, we had a small ceremony to give out the awards to the various academic, CCA and Character Development winners. We also recognised students leaders for their active contributions to the school and students who have overcome adversity to make significant progress in school. Thank you partners for your contributions. It was indeed a day of joy and celebrations!
