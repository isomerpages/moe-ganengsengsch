<p>In 2025, GESS celebrates its 140<sup>th</sup> year of educating the young.
It started as a school for the poor and its Founder, Mr Gan Eng Seng, had
a vision for Gessians to be active, contributing members of the community
like he did. &nbsp;In line with his vision, the school and the students
had initiated many values-in-action projects, one of which was meeting
the needs of the senior citizens in the Henderson- Dawson area. It is heartening
to see that even upon graduating from GESS, many continue to serve the
nation in their own capacity. The value of compassion and the strong desire
to reach out to people are what make our students truly Gessians.</p>

<p><strong><em>140 Good Deeds</em></strong>
<br>As part of our 140th anniversary celebrations, GESS initiated the 140
Good Deeds Initiative. From 8 March 2024 to 14 March 2025 (Founderâ€™s Day),
the school counted the good deeds carried out by our staff, students, and
partners. The countdown celebrated the collective spirit of giving and
community throughout this special year.</p>

<p><strong><em>GESS140 Record Breaking</em></strong>
<br>As part of the series of events marking Gan Eng Seng School's 140th anniversary,
we aim to set a new record with a groundbreaking exercise on 3 January
2025: creating the largest human formation of the number "140." This ambitious
project will involve students, staff, SAC, GESSOSA, and members of the
PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) coming together to form the symbolic figure
on the very school arena. The event not only showcases the school's commitment
to unity and community spirit but also serves as a vivid tribute to Gan
Eng Seng's enduring legacy and the values of discipline, resilience, and
progress encapsulated in the school motto, "Onward."</p>

<br><strong><em>GESS140 Cycle for a Cause</em><br></strong>Another special
event that took place from 13 March 2025 to 14 March 2025 was the "Cycle
for a Cause" event. This overnight event promoted health, community spirit,
and philanthropy while embodying the school's core values of discipline
and resilience. Each cyclist cycled a designated route in teams and raised
funds for the Singapore Disability Sports Council, demonstrating their
commitment to the school's motto, "Onward." The event saw active participation
from the SAC, GESSOSA, the school's alumni association, and the PTA (Parent-Teacher
Association). This relay not only honored our Founder Gan Eng Seng's legacy
but also fostered unity among the school and its key partners, highlighting
the school's dedication to making a positive impact on the community.
