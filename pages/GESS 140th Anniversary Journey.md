<p>In 2025, the school will be celebrating a key milestone of 140 years in
educating generations of pupils.</p>
<p>In 1885, Gan Eng Seng School was founded in Tanjong Pagar by Mr Gan Eng
Seng to offer free education to the children of poor parents in the vicinity.
It was called the Anglo-Chinese Free School. The school is the first school
established by the overseas Chinese community in Singapore and is one of
the oldest schools in the country.
<br>
<br>Gan Eng was a boys' school for 102 years before it became co-educational
in 1987.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gan_Eng_Seng_School#cite_note-ST-010985-3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup> </sup></a>The
school was also the first in Singapore to form a parent-teachers' association
in 1950.
<br>The school believes that teachers are the key catalysts for innovation
and improvements in the delivery of student-centric, values-driven education.
<br>
<br>The school continues to work closely with parents and the community to
value-add to the studentsâ€™ educational and socio-emotional development.
These partnerships enhance the holistic development of the students and
prepare them well for the 21st century.
<br>
<br><strong>140 Good Deeds</strong> 
<br>The entire school community, including staff, pupils, parents, alumni,
and stakeholders, collaborates by contributing time and resources to carry
out 140 good deeds. These acts of kindness encompass a variety of initiatives,
such as organizing fundraising events for local charities, participating
in community clean-up projects, mentoring younger students, and volunteering
at local shelters. Each member of the school community plays a vital role
in these efforts, demonstrating a shared commitment to making a positive
impact both within and beyond the school environment. By working together,
they not only enhance the school's spirit of unity and generosity but also
foster a culture of social responsibility and compassion that extends into
the wider community.</p>
