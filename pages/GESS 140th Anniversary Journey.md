<p>In 2025, GESS celebrates its 140<sup>th</sup> year of educating the young.
It started as a school for the poor and its Founder, Mr Gan Eng Seng, had
a vision for Gessians to be active, contributing members of the community
like he did. &nbsp;In line with his vision, the school and the students
had initiated many values-in-action projects, one of which was meeting
the needs of the senior citizens in the Henderson- Dawson area. It is heartening
to see that even upon graduating from GESS, many continue to serve the
nation in their own capacity. The value of compassion and the strong desire
to reach out to people are what make our students truly Gessians.</p>

<br>As part of our 140<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations, GESS has initiated
the 140 Good Deeds Initiative. Starting 8 March 2024 and ending on 14 March
2025 (Founderâ€™s Day), the school will do a count down of all the good deeds
done by our staff, students and partners. Let the count down begin!!!</p>

<p><strong><em>GESS 140 Record Breaking</em></strong>
<br>As part of the series of events marking Gan Eng Seng School's 140th anniversary,
we aims to set a new record with a groundbreaking exercise on 3 January
2025: creating the largest human formation of the number "140." This ambitious
project will involve students, staff, SAC, GESSOSA, and members of the
PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) coming together to form the symbolic figure
on the very school arena. The event not only showcases the school's commitment
to unity and community spirit but also serves as a vivid tribute to Gan
Eng Seng's enduring legacy and the values of discipline, resilience, and
progress encapsulated in the school motto, "Onward."
<br>
<br><strong><em>GESS140 Cycle for a Cause</em><br></strong>Gan Eng Seng School's
140th anniversary will be celebrated with a special "Cycle for a Cause"
event from 13 March 2025 to 14<sup>th</sup> March 2025. This overnight event
aims to promote health, community spirit, and philanthropy while embodying
the school's core values of discipline and resilience. Each cyclist will
cycle a designated route in teams, raising funds for Singapore Disability
Sports Council and demonstrating their commitment to the school's motto,
"Onward." The event will see the active participation of SAC, GESSOSA,
the school's alumni association, and the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association).
This relay not only honors &nbsp;our Founder Gan Eng Seng's legacy but
also fosters unity among the school and its key partners, highlighting
the school's dedication to making a positive impact on the community.
