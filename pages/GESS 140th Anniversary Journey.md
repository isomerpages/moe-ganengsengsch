<p>In 2025, GESS celebrates its 140<sup>th</sup> year of educating the young.
It started as a school for the poor and its Founder, Mr Gan Eng Seng, had
a vision for Gessians to be active, contributing members of the community
like he did. &nbsp;In line with his vision, the school and the students
had initiated many values-in-action projects, one of which was meeting
the needs of the senior citizens in the Henderson- Dawson area. It is heartening
to see that even upon graduating from GESS, many continue to serve the
nation in their own capacity. The value of compassion and the strong desire
to reach out to people are what make our students truly Gessians.</p>

<p>As part of our 140<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations, GESS has initiated
the 140 Good Deeds Initiative. Starting 8 March 2024 and ending on 14 March
2025 (Founderâ€™s Day), the school will do a count down of all the good deeds
done by our staff, students and partners. Let the count down begin!!!</p>
