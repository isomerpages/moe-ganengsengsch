<h4 style="color:black" align="center">Mr Johnny Heng, PBM<br>Class of 1987</h4>

Mr Johnny Heng is Managing Director and Head of the Singapore branch in Liechtenstein-based VP Bank. He holds a Bachelor of Arts (Economics) from the National University of Singapore, a Master of Finance from Baruch College of The City University of New York and a Juris Doctor from the Singapore University of Social Sciences. He is married with 3 sons and his hobbies include playing football, badminton and golf. Two GESS teachers who left lasting impressions were Mr Lim Bun and Mr Wong Kwang Pin. As his Track and Field teacher/coach, Mr Lim taught him the art of succeeding by competing in the “less crowded field”. Mr Wong, as his NPCC teacher-in-charge, instilled in him the importance of leadership by example. He hopes for GESS to be an all-rounded school that lives up to her name by providing GESSIANs, present and future, with a balanced holistic secondary school experience.
