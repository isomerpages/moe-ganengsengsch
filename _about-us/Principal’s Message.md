When I joined Gan Eng Seng School in December 2019, the Covid pandemic was already underway. Our team had to deal with many changes and the past year has been eventful. I am thankful that on the whole, we have managed to move on together and some form of normalcy is brought back to schools. The removal of masks is a welcome first step as we can now interact with one another without our faces obscured, and in some cases, seeing each other’s faces for the very first time. This is especially important in a school environment, where social mixing allows students to develop their social and emotional skills. I am thankful for the immense support rendered by my staff who shouldered this challenging journey with the students with a clear purpose of bringing the best of the educational experiences to them. Our partners especially School Advisory Committee, GESSOSA and PTA also walked this journey with us, rallying support and giving us hope that we are together as a TEAM for our students. It is my sincere wish that our Gessians will embrace every opportunity to serve others whenever and wherever they can to show their gratitude.

**_Onward, Onward, Gan Eng Seng For Gessians_**

The chorus of our school anthem goes,

‘Onward, Onward, _Gan Eng Seng for Gessians._

_Onward, Onward, Gessians for Gan Eng Seng.’_

These are powerful and inspiring words that resonate not only with our current students and staff, but with the numerous cohorts that have successfully passed through our school's gates over its illustrious history. Our brand of education has evolved significantly over the years as a result of the changing educational landscape and the changing demands of the real world. The school is cognizant that it is no longer adequate to prepare our students for post-secondary education alone as a significant portion of what they learn in school will become obsolete by the time they join the workforce. By providing our students with the right values, attitude, dispositions, and soft skills through our curricular and co-curricular programs, we equip them to learn, unlearn, and relearn to survive in a world full of uncertainties. A few distinctive programmes are worthy of mention here; namely the Applied Learning Programme that brings about Gessians who are active contributors to our nation’s sustainability efforts. As a pedagogical tool, design thinking allows students to explore real-world challenges and find viable solutions. I'm happy to share that Faith De Vera and Cody Tan (class of 2018) were featured in The Straits Times (dated 4 Oct 2022) for their innovative tech solutions designed to assist people with disabilities. It is indeed heartening to see Gessians making the world a better place for others.

Gessians are given the opportunity to stretch their potentials through workshops and competitions like the Model United Nations-Dunman High ASEAN Plus conference, as well as collaborating with schools like Raffles Institution in the sciences through GESS Capstone programmes. Through virtual sharing, we have established new partnerships with Brunei and Thailand schools in order to promote global awareness and cross-cultural skills in our students. Our Learn For Life Programme (LLP) aims to develop every Gessian to be a principled leader and an active citizen through student leadership development, Values-in-Action programme and Camp experiences.

GESS has over time formed and strengthened strategic partnerships anchored on two key guiding principles: it should be purpose-driven and sustainable. We identify key stakeholders to provide every Gessian with a holistic learning experience to realise the intended student outcomes of a principled leader, engaged learner, reflective and innovative thinker and active citizen. I would like to make special mention of two key partners, our School Advisory Committee (SAC) and the Gan Eng Seng Old Students’ Association (GESSOSA). Both consist of senior Gessians who continue to have a heart to serve the school. During the height of the pandemic in 2020, SAC started the Gessian Series where current Sec 3, 4 and 5 students are exposed to the world of work, financial literacy and technology such as metaverse. This has evolved to a whole-school approach where lower sec students also benefit from SAC sharing with the Start-it-Right orientation programme for the Sec 1s and the subject combination talk for the Sec 2s.  GESSOSA supported the Education and Career Guidance programme through its talks, and it also supported the Founder’s Day VIA component. Both were also actively involved in the re-designed GESS Heritage Gallery; SAC provided the funding while GESSOSA provided the expertise and the curation of the artefacts. It is heartening to see the strong bonds our senior Gessians have for the school and how readily they lend a hand when needed. Thank you very much!

In the subsequent pages of this Yearbook, you will see the Onward Spirit of the Gessians in action, be it in the Founder’s Day Values-in-Action activity, National Day Celebrations or the half-marathon challenge sponsored by the Parent-Teacher-Association. It is my hope that as you flip through the pages, you will see our students growing to be Gessians of Excellence, Standing and Significance.

ONWARD
