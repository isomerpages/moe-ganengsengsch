2025 has been a truly remarkable year as we proudly celebrated the 140th anniversary of Gan Eng Seng School, one of Singapore's oldest educational institutions. Founded by the visionary philanthropist Mr Gan Eng Seng, our school has grown from humble beginnings with a clear mission to serve the community into a dynamic and resilient beacon of education that embraces change whilst staying true to our Gessian values.

Our 140th anniversary beautifully coincides with Singapore's diamond jubilee—60 years of nationhood. Our theme, 'Celebrating our legacy and embracing the future', encapsulates this momentous dual celebration, reflecting both our school's enduring heritage and our nation's remarkable journey. This alignment underscores the deep connection between GESS and Singapore's development, as we have grown together as partners in nation-building and educational excellence.

This milestone year would not have been possible without tremendous support from our community partners and stakeholders. I extend heartfelt gratitude to our partners such as APSN Tanglin School and Henderson Dawson Community Club for providing invaluable opportunities for our graduating cohorts to exercise their self-initiated values-in-action projects. Our appreciation also goes to giving.sg for enabling our school community, partners, parents and the public to contribute meaningfully towards the Singapore Disability Sports Association, demonstrating the spirit of giving that defines our Gessian values.

Special recognition goes to GESSOSA for hosting a truly memorable GESS 140th Anniversary dinner that brought together generations of Gessians in celebration of our shared heritage. I am equally grateful to our School Advisory Committee and Parent-Teacher Association for their unwavering support throughout this anniversary year. Their dedication and partnership have been instrumental in making our celebrations meaningful and successful.

I wish to acknowledge our dedicated staff who have worked tirelessly to plan and execute memorable activities throughout this anniversary year, including our record-breaking Singapore Book of Records achievement, the inspiring Creative Wall project, and our meaningful Founder's Day celebrations. Our students have excelled across many areas—we continue to produce value-added academic results, our CCAs have achieved impressive milestones, and our students consistently shine in their endeavours. These initiatives have created lasting memories and strengthened the bonds within our school community.

Moving forward, our school remains steadfast in our commitment to the Future of Learning. We continue to focus on emerging 21st Century Competencies, educational technology and innovative learning spaces to ensure our Gessians are future-ready. Our dedication to preparing students for tomorrow's challenges drives our continuous progression in pedagogical approaches and educational excellence.

Additionally, our Gessians will benefit from an expanded internationalisation programme covering countries such as China, Thailand and Brunei. These experiences will broaden their global perspectives, deepen their cultural understanding, and prepare them to thrive in an interconnected world.

As we reflect on this remarkable 140-year journey, we celebrate not just our achievements, but the collaborative spirit and unwavering support that continues to propel Gan Eng Seng School towards greater heights. Together, we have created a legacy that honours our past whilst embracing the future with confidence and purpose.

Onward Gessians!
