<strong>Doing the Right Things — Transforming Learning for Every Gessian</strong>
<br><br>
At Gan Eng Seng School, our journey has always been guided by a simple
yet powerful belief — that education must not only prepare our students
to succeed but also shape them to do what is right. Over the years, we
have emphasised the importance of doing things well. As we move forward
together, we are called to go one step further — to ensure that we are
doing the right things for every Gessian entrusted to our care.
<br><br>
Our founder, Mr Gan Eng Seng, believed deeply in the transformative power
of education. His legacy continues to inspire us to nurture confident learners,
principled leaders, and compassionate citizens who embody our school values.
These values — Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity and Care
— remain the foundation upon which we build the Gessian experience. &nbsp;<br><br>In
2026, our collective focus is on <strong>Transforming Classroom Practices</strong>.
We believe that the classroom is where school vision becomes lived reality.
When learning is engaging, meaningful and authentic, students do not simply
acquire knowledge — they develop curiosity, agency and confidence. Our
goal is therefore not only to strengthen teaching strategies, but to enrich
the daily learning experiences of our students so that every lesson becomes
an opportunity for growth.
<br><br>
This transformation is anchored in three key commitments:
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<strong>First, deepening student engagement.</strong>
<br>We seek to encourage more active participation — where students think
critically, collaborate meaningfully and apply their learning to real-world
contexts. Engagement is not about entertainment; it is about ownership.
When students feel invested in their learning, they are more motivated
to strive and to persevere.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Second, strengthening relationships and belonging.</strong>
<br>Every Gessian should feel known, valued and supported. Positive relationships
between teachers and students create the psychological safety necessary
for learning and growth. We want our students to experience school as a
place where they are encouraged to take risks, learn from mistakes and
discover their strengths.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Third, nurturing character alongside competence.</strong>
<br>Academic success remains important, but character defines the choices
our students make when faced with challenges. Through our programmes and
daily interactions, we continue to cultivate integrity, empathy and resilience
— qualities that will serve our students well beyond school.
</li>
</ul>
As educators, transformation begins with us. We will continue to invest
in professional learning and collaborative practices so that our teachers
remain reflective practitioners who innovate with purpose. When teachers
grow, students flourish. The spirit of “Onward” has been part of Gan Eng
Seng School since its founding — a reminder that progress is achieved through
perseverance, courage and collective effort. Today, this spirit calls us
to embrace change thoughtfully, guided by what matters most: the growth
and well-being of our students.
<br><br>
To our students, I encourage you to make the most of every opportunity
— to be curious, to be brave in learning, and to care for those around
you. To our parents and partners, thank you for your continued trust and
support as we work together to nurture our young people.
<br><br>
As one GESS community, let us continue to move <strong>Onward</strong> —
not just doing things right, but doing the right things — for the future
of every Gessian.
<br>
<em>Doing the Right Things, Together — Onward as One GESS!</em>
