The GESS Learning for Life Programme (LLP), also known as the GESS LIFE programme, launched in July 2014, seeks to develop students to be confident and effective student leaders who positively impact their community through the 3D approach – **Discovering** myself, **Developing** good habits, and **Designing** our world.

Students discover themselves and develop a better appreciation of one another’s uniqueness using the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment, a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. They will learn simple and effective strategies to leverage their strengths and build competencies in other areas, and collaborate with others.

As an integral part of the GESS LIFE programme, the annual cohort GESS LIFE Camp will equip our students with effective strategies and skills to enhance self-management, develop resilience and focus, improve team collaboration, and to understand and appreciate cross-cultural issues.

With a healthy understanding of self and others, and effective habits developed in oneself, GESSIANs are able to design the world they live in. The LIFE programme will provide school-wide, cohort and personal opportunities for every student to purposefully and competently apply their knowledge and skills to impact their families, school, community, nation and the world.
