The school’s Applied Learning Programme has been implemented since 2015. Our ALP serves to prepare our students for their future workplace by infusing Design Thinking (Fig. 1) into the curriculum. Students are given opportunities to apply their learning onto real world STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) challenges.
