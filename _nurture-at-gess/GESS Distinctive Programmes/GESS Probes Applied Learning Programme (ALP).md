The school’s Applied Learning Programme has been implemented since 2015. Our ALP serves to prepare our students for their future workplace by infusing Design Thinking (Fig. 1) into the curriculum. Students are given opportunities to apply their learning onto real world STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) challenges.

The programme is titled Probes\* to emphasise the school’s desire to develop all Gessians as innovative and reflective thinkers through the ALP. This programme consists of two tiers: Tier 1 is a broad-based programme for all students while Tier 2 caters to students with the interest in and aptitude for STEM, and they are developed as part of the school’s talent development programme.

Between 2016 to 2020, Gessians were given the opportunities to deepen their learning in different platforms. These platforms ranged from building their own water filter and testing their effectiveness, learning how to code in Arduino or Micro:Bit to tinkering with controllable variables like temperature and humidity of indoor incubators to grow their own vegetables. The variety of activities planned for Gessians supported their learning by making connections of what they have learnt in class to actual applications in the real world.

Here are some photographs to illustrate the ALP lessons in action and some of our students’ achievements at national platforms.

From 2021, Gessians will experience more platforms for authentic applications of learning across subjects as more departments come on board this exciting endeavor. The ALP also includes Learning Journeys and interactions with practitioners and experts in various fields of knowledge. Centred on the theme of sustainability, the ALP aims to engage all Gessians in their learning and development towards becoming future-ready global citizens.
