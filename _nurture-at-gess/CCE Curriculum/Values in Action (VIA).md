The GESS Values in Action (VIA) programme is aligned to the Love-Embodied trait in our Gessian Portrait. Gessians go through a structured and developmental VIA programme to ensure progressive, coherent and sustainable learning. The programme also provides Gessians with the opportunity to understand the issues that the beneficiaries are facing and then decide how they can make a sustained change to them. Teachers act as facilitators and mentors to support our students in their group endeavours. There are also whole-school VIA projects weaved into our Chinese New Year and Founderâ€™s Day celebrations.

ViA experiences allow our Gessians to interact with and understand people of different backgrounds. These efforts to bring youths and the larger community together help to develop empathy for others. As Gessians serve the community, they often learn important life lessons as well.
