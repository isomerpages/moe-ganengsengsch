**PROGRAMMES**  
At GESS, we believe in providing our students with authentic learning experiences to increase their awareness of their strengths, and possible educational and career pathways upon graduation. This is done at various levels:

**1\. Job Shadowing Programme for Secondary 1s**  
The Job Shadowing Programme provides an opportunity for students to connect with the world of work through experiencing first-hand the work environment of their family members. Students are encouraged to make connections between their learning in school, and real-life contexts.  
Students who had participated in the Job-shadowing Programme in 2019 shared they had grown a deeper appreciation of the importance of different industries that their family members are involved in. As students hear their classmates share their experiences at the end of this Programme, they too gain broader perspectives of career possibilities and the working world.

**2\. Subject Combination Talks for Secondary 2s**
