<h5 style="color:black" align="center"> GESS Holistic Education Framework</h5>

### Rationale

Gan Eng Seng School (GESS) is guided by the NURTURE@GESS Framework which anchors on the belief that education in the 21st century is about nurturing the whole person. Centred on GESS vision, mission and values, this holistic framework focuses on four key areas: Quality Learning and Teaching, Quality Experience, Quality Relationship and Character-based Education. These are supported by the learning structures, social processes and affiliation which aim at the holistic development of all Gessians.

Education is about nurturing the whole person; developing the child morally, intellectually, physically, socially and aesthetically. This is in line with our school’s philosophy, vision and mission and the school’s core values (Discipline, Integrity, Respect, and Resilience).

To provide for this overall development of pupils, there is a need to provide a framework that is holistic, proactive and systematic. This framework is known as the Nurture@GESS Framework.

The Nurture@GESS Framework is in line with the school’s Strategic Thrusts.  It provides directions in planning school programmes which focuses on providing Quality School Experience through Learning Structures, Social Processes and Affiliation.

The five domains in the Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), namely Self Awareness, Social Awareness, Self-Management, Relationship Management and Responsible Decision Making, have been incorporated into the framework to ensure a character-based education.

### Guiding Principles

The guiding principles for the NURTURE@GESS framework are;

*   Every pupil can learn.
*   Pupils should be given the opportunities to enrich themselves and maximise their abilities or talents.
*   Improved quality of teaching and learning can have a significant impact on the standards of pupils’ work and performance.

### Nurture@GESS Development Plan

NURTURE@GESS provides a holistic education to all pupils through two main domains;

1.  Instructional Programme (formal curriculum) and
2.  Character Development (informal curriculum).

The Instructional programme (IP) constitutes the formal curriculum in which the syllabus are stipulated and guided by MOE CPDD.

The Character and Citizenship Development (CCE) component encompasses the informal curriculum such as character and citizenship development programme, social and emotional learning and physical development and aesthetics. Components of CCE are usually in the form of formal CCE lesson and enrichment programmes that complement the formal curriculum.

In 2011, the school is chosen as one of the project study school to infuse 21st Century Competencies into the total curriculum. As part of her continuing effort to teach students to ‘Know the Good’, ‘Desire the Good’ and ‘Do the Good’, the four aspects of the _Parallel Curriculum Model_ serve as the guiding principles to deliver a quality curriculum in GESS. The tagline ‘Our Quality, Their Future’ serves as an anchoring belief for all staff at GESS in providing the best for the GESS family through the PLC.
