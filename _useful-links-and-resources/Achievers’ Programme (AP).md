**The GESS Achievers’ Programme (AP) is a weekly programme that takes place after curriculum hours every Monday and Wednesday, targeting students who require more time and practice in particular subjects.**

**Through the GESS Achievers’ Programme, we hope to…**

1.  reinforce subject-specific skills and content;
2.  provide our students with more opportunities to clarify their doubts;
3.  increase our students’ confidence in a particular subject; and
4.  cultivate good study habits that would serve our students well, in the examinations and beyond.

**As partners in education, we hope that parents can help the school by…**

1.  encouraging your child/ward to attend the AP sessions faithfully;
2.  scheduling your child’s/ward’s out-of-school commitments around the AP programme; and
3.  cheering your child/ward for his/her academic efforts.
