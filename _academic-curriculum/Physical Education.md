### Vision

Gessians with healthy bodies and minds

### Mission

To equip Gessians with life skills to lead a healthy and active lifestyle

### About

The Physical Education (PE) Department advocates the importance of sports education, sports participation and the provision of opportunities for further and continual sports development amongst our students.  Students learn and acquire skills in the physical, cognitive and affective domains when engaging in sport activities like cross country, indoor rowing and Sports Fiesta. We also empower our Sport Leaders to organise games for students on Sports Wednesday.  The display of our school values like discipline, resilience and respect are evident when our students partake in these healthy lifestyle activities.
