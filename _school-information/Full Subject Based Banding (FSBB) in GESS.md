Subject-Based Banding (SBB) was piloted in twelve secondary schools in 2014, to provide greater flexibility in lower secondary subject combinations. Under SBB, students who perform well in certain subjects would be given the opportunity to offer them at a higher level.

Six years on, MOE is piloting Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) in 2020, and it will be introduced progressively to all secondary schools by 2024.

When FSBB is fully implemented, students from the Express, Normal (Academic), and Normal (Technical) streams will be merged into a single course of study. The video below explains in greater detail what FSBB is all about:

**We are delighted to announce that GESS has been chosen to be one of the pilot schools for FSBB in 2020.**

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a name="Link2"></a>How does FSBB work?</strong></p>

<img src="/images/group-potrait-3.jpeg" style="width:120px;height:220px;margin-left:15px;" align = "left"> Under FSBB, all the subjects students offer are categorised into two groups – those in the Common Curriculum, and those offered as SBB subjects at different levels.

The Common Curriculum comprises the following subjects, which are taught to the entire form class:

*   Art;
*   Character and Citizenship Education (CCE);
*   Design & Technology (D&T);
*   Food and Consumer Education (FCE);
*   Music; and
*   Physical Education (PE)

The following are the SBB subjects offered in GESS :

*   English Language;
*   Mother Tongue Languages;
*   Mathematics;
*   Science;
*   Geography;
*   History;
*   Literature in English

During SBB lessons, students are offered in ability-banded classes — Express, N(A), and N(T).

So how does this all work? To illustrate, let us take an example of three students from the same form class, who offer the SBB subjects at different levels:

In this case, we can see that while all three students attend the same Common Curriculum lessons, they will go to different classes for the other subjects’ lessons. This may involve them ‘merging’ with students from another form class.

Let’s hear a couple of our teachers’ thoughts about FSBB, and how the school has been preparing for the pilot:
