### Vision

To develop passion for the Arts in all GESSians

### Mission

To provide opportunities for all GESSians to Appreciate, Contribute to, and Experience the Arts

### About

The GESS Aesthetics Department seeks to promote GESSians’ strong participation and development of knowledge, skills and attitudes in a diversity of forms of art, music, lifestyles and consumer trends.

In **Art**, students learn to perceive, communicate and appreciate Art through thematic projects. They hone their artistic dispositions and explore means of expressing themselves using a variety of media such as drawing, painting and digital photography. Beyond making art, students learnt from artists and artworks through learning journeys to art exhibitions. During the Aesthetics Week, students also get the opportunity to showcase their artworks.

In **Music**, students develop musical capacities through a variety of activities and repertoire. Through inclusive pedagogies such as informal learning, students are given the opportunity to create, listen and perform collaboratively within curriculum time. Our school-wide talent development initiative, GESS Got Talent, provides a platform for students to further hone their musicality and performance skills. Newly introduced in 2021, GESS Playlist is an initiative to expose our students to different genres of music during the Morning Assembly programme.

In **Nutrition and Food Science**, we focus on the importance of the diet in promoting  overall health. The topics covered will enable students to better appreciate and develop the understanding of not just a holistic diet but also how food is an important part of multicultural literacy in the global context. To prepare students for the 21st Century, we use inquiry-based learning where the hands-on approach in an authentic learning context allows students to relate and apply the knowledge gained in real-life situations.
