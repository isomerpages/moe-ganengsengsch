Dear parents/guardians,

From 1 Apr 2020, schools will progressively transit to a blended learning model, starting with one day of Home-Based Learning (HBL) a week.

Gan Eng Seng School is not new to HBL as we have regularly conducted e-learning for students at least once a year. Our students are familiar with the process and the expectations of the school.

This issue of Parent Kit provides tips on how you can support your child’s/ward’s HBL and addresses some of your concerns.

 Join MOE’s Facebook Live Session, “Ask Me Anything About… Home-Based Learning” on 1 April 2020, 8pm, to learn more about what HBL really means and the role you can play in your child’s/ward’s HBL. Click on the link below to RSVP.
