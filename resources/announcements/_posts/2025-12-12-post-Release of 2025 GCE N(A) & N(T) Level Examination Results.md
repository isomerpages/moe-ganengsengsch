<p>Dear Gessians,</p>
<p></p>
<p>All the best to those who are collecting their results on 18 December
2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please report to the school’s Old Rifle Range by 1.45 pm in full school
uniform and adhere to the guidelines for appropriate appearance stipulated
in the GESS Student Handbook.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who are unable to collect their results in person, they can appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. School
candidates may contact the school for assistance if they are unable to
appoint a proxy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Onward Gessians!</p>
