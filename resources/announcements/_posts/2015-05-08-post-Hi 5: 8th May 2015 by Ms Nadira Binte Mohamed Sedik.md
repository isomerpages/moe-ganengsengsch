Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, teachers and fellow Gessians. It is my pleasure to deliver this morning’s Hi 5.  
This week marks the 2nd week of the ongoing Mid-Year Examination. I am sure many of you would have faced challenges in one way or another while preparing or even during the exams. While some take it in their stride others might feel like calling it quits. Sometimes, we fail to recognise that challenges make us stronger. It is through challenges that we are able to fly and soar higher. Allow me to share with you a story. A story on Mr APJ Kalaam who was the president of India from 2002 to 2007.

Growing up, Mr Kalaam’s sole ambition was to be a pilot. To realise this dream, he had to go through several interviews. He gave his best during the interviews. He felt confident and at the same time tense. Finally, when the results were announced, he stood ninth in a batch of twenty-five. As there were only eight available places, he had failed to realise his dream of becoming an air force pilot. While he felt despaired, he did not allow his setback to get the better of him. Instead he overcame this challenge and obstacle by searching for his destined path in life, where he eventually became a renowned aerospace scientist.  
So Gessians, what have we learnt from this story? One thing for sure, it is telling us that sometimes we will in one way or another face with unexpected obstacles or challenges in life. These challenges are a part of our journey and preparing us for what awaits. Indeed, in our ability to transcend obstacles and challenges, we find hidden reserves of resilience we do not know we have.

Last year, in preparing my secondary 4 students for the ‘O’ level examination, I was very much confident one of my student was definitely getting a distinction for her Malay Language. She had been consistently performing in the subject and it was not a problem for her to ace it. Nevertheless, the unexpected happen. She did not achieve her goals. Though despaired, she did not give up hope. Instead, she took her failure as a challenge. She picked up her strength and continued to forge on. She obtained distinction in her second attempt.

Dear Gessians, in the midst of you taking your exam, I hope all of you will be resilient enough to overcome any obstacles and achieve success. Continue to be steadfast in all the things you undertake. May you rise to become Gessians of excellence, standing and significance.

With that, all the best in your examination and have a good weekend.

Thank you.
