Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, teachers and all Gessians.

I am confident that you know who I am by now. I am Sin Jia Xin from Class 3D. As a Head Prefect nominee, I am interested in improving the experiences you have in school. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about one such improvement I have in mind today.

One event that almost everyone looks forward to is the post-exam activity. After an intense period of studying, we finally get an opportunity to unwind, pick up new skills and bond with our classmates. For the past two years, I have always looked forward to post-exam activities and they have never disappointed me. I remembered two years ago, I tried dragon boating for the first time with my class. It was a really great experience and I had a lot of fun!

I hope that everyone can also have great experiences at the post-exam activities just like me! As such I have plans to get you involve in organizing the post-exam activities! I intend to do so by conducting an online survey to gather feedback from the student body about the type of post-exam activities you would enjoy and benefit from.

With regard to the gathering of feedback, I feel that as a school, there ought to be many channels and avenues for you to provide feedback. With my proposal, I believe every Gessian will feel a greater sense of belonging to the school, as we are able to voice our thoughts. So, start thinking about what you hope to experience for this year’s post-exam activities and let me know!

Although conducting surveys is a good way to hear from every one of you, rest assured that I will also make myself available to speak to you in person. You have my assurance that I will be ready to listen to your feedback, whether it is related to post- exam activities, student welfare or school improvement matters. I will be there to offer my assistance to anyone who may need it.

Before I end off, I am certain that all of you still remember the sharing I did about my personality and my symbol, which is the optimistic, trustworthy and forward-looking sunflower. Do approach me if there’s anything I can help you with. Together, we can make Gan Eng Seng School a better place for all of us!

Thank you!
