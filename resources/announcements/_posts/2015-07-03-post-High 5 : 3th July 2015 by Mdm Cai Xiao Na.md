Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, Fellow Colleagues and Gessians, good morning!  
Gessians, I will give you one minute to take out your GESS Life Book to take down important notes.  
Today marks the last day of Term 3 week one. I hope after one week, all of you have settle down and get ready for Semester 2. Since it is week one, I am not going to wear you out, and I have only three items to share with you in the Hi5 today.

Firstly, let’s recap one of the four school values which we will keep referring to in term 3. Earlier this week, Mr John Yim had talked about it in his Take5 speech. Can anyone come up here and tell us what is the value I am referring to? You will receive a chocolate bar from me for answering this simple question…………

(Wait for student to answer the question………Can you tell us your name and class?………………….)  
Thank you. Yes, we are talking about Respect. As a student, to show your respect to teachers means handing in homework on time. Do you agree? Today is the last day of week one. How many of you have handed in all holiday homework to your teachers? Let’s have a look, can those who handed in all holiday homework put up your hands proudly? ………ermm… I see many of you have done so, that’s good! But I know, some of you still have outstanding works. What should you do? Better complete the homework by this Sunday, so that next week you don’t have someone chasing you on the matter.

Secondly, let’s talk about silver target. By now, all of you should have received a new silver target card. Some of you achieved silver target in Semester one, some almost achieved, some still have a long way to go. And there are some who are struggling to meet the minimum requirement for promotion. If you fall in this category, you have to work hard and catch up. I believe none of us want to be found attending FA cup at the end of the year. Let’s all show respect to yourself and fulfill your potential.

Lastly, let’s talk about O Level CL Oral exam. Currently, Sec 3 HCL students, Sec 4 and Sec 5 CL students are taking CL Oral exam. We all know that the Oral exam contribute 25% of O level exam results. Thus it is a very important component.

I strongly encourage these students take every opportunity to use your mother tongue language, be it CL, ML or TL, in daily activities throughout the oral exam period. For example, talk to your classmates, friends during recess in school, or communicate with your parents at home in your mother tongue language. Some of them may respond in English, but you should persevere. I am sure your effort will be paid off in the end.  
In a world which is volatile and always changing, there is still a room for tradition, heritage and self-respect. Honour your gifts and do your best to serve your school, your community and your nation!

That’s the end of my speech. Let’s all gear up for week 2. And I wish all a happy weekend ahead.

Thank you!
