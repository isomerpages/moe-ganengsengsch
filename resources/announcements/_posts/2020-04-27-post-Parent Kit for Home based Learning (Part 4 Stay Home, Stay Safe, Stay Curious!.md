Dear parents/guardians,

Thank you for standing by your teens and supporting schools through the HBL period!

With the upcoming holidays, your teens will be spending more time at home. This presents you with the opportunity to deepen your relationship with your teens and bond more as a family. By making small changes to what you say and do, you can relate better to your teenager, and equip them with the much needed support and positive attitude needed for life.

This issue of Parent Kit provides you with tips on how you can frame your conversations with your teenagers positively, and things you can do to guide your teenagers to become mentally and emotionally resilient. It also suggests ways in which your family (your teens included) can bond while showing care for each other. #SGunited

#wearebehindyou #Sgunited

Onward!
