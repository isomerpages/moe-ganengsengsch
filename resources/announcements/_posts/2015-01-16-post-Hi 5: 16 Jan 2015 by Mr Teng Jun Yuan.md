Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, Fellow Colleagues and Gessians,

Today, I am delivering the Hi 5 for the week. Today marks the end of the 2nd week of Term 1 and I would like to highlight the qualities of our GESSians which make us proud.

The first 2 qualities which I want to highlight are resilience and discipline.

The release of the O level results on Monday is the day which the Sec 4 class of 2014 reap their harvest. The Sec 4s have put in their hard work and I would like to highlight the achievements of one particular student who has overcome the odds and did well.

Bi Xun came into GESS in 2011 as a Sec 1 NT student. Not doing well for his PSLE did not discourage him from putting in effective effort to do well in his studies. He believed in himself, dreamed big and worked hard at becoming better. His efforts paid off and at the end of Sec 1, he managed to do well enough to be laterally transferred to 2NA.

His success in the first year did not stop him from achieving more. Despite the steep learning curve when moving from 1NT to 2NA, he did well again to be laterally transferred to 3 Express at the end of Sec 2. In Sec 4, his perseverance and outstanding character paid off when he clinched 4 O levels distinctions and also the MOE Edusave Character Award.  
Bi Xun’s story of true grit and determination will not be possible without the self-discipline and resilience he displayed to overcome his difficulties.

The next quality I would like to highlight is integrity. First of all I would like to praise the following GESSians who have lived up to the school’s value of integrity. They are Jeremy Lee of 1C, Lee Jia Ying of 1E and Lee Ray Yi Rayna of 1D.

Last Friday, Jeremy Lee of 1C picked up a handphone at the school’s foyer. Even though no one was looking, he picked up the phone and handed it to the general office. On the 1st day of school Lee Jia Ying of 1E and Lee Ray Yi Rayna of 1D found $50. Instead of keeping the money, these students did the right thing when no one was looking and returned the money. These acts of honesty exemplify the school values of integrity and deserve our recognition.

Gessians knowing the good, desiring the good and doing the good is what makes a Gessian. On that note, we would hope to see and share more good acts of Gessians and Gessians continue to paint the Gessian portrait which we are all proud of.

Onward Gessians.
