Today’s High 5 story is about the habit of mind – listening with understanding and empathy. Please take out the GESS Life Book and jot down your reflections after listening to my sharing.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) invited Singaporeans to give their feedback in preparation for Budget 2016, which will be [delivered by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/finance-minister-to-present-budget-on-march-24) on March 24.  A website dedicated to the Singapore Budget 2016 has been set up, which includes suggestions and views from Singaporeans on what this year’s budget should cover.  Members of the public also participated in the Pre-Budget Conversation and FaceBook Q&A session, the session on [REACH’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/REACHSingapore/?fref=ts) or contributed on Twitter.

Singapore’s upcoming Budget aims to take in inputs from business associations, unions, and members of the public via different platforms.  In response, individuals, households, and businesses have suggested ways on how we can best develop Singaporeans and help local companies grow through innovation and internationalisation.  These suggestions include equipping Singaporeans with skills to prepare them for the future economy, harnessing technology to make life better, and building an inclusive society that addresses the needs of the elderly and vulnerable groups.

Some of the feedback received may differ on the same issue, because the Singaporeans contributing this feedback may come from different backgrounds or perspectives when they talk about the same issue.  However, by seeking input from different backgrounds in society and acknowledging these differing needs, the government has adopted the habit of mind of reaching out and listening to people from different sectors before making a judgment as to what’s appropriate for the Singapore economy and for employment. It is important to listen to all feedback so that the government can address the worries of as many people as possible, e.g. slower economic growth, job security and support for families.

Gessians, I encourage you to adopt the same habit of mind when you’re confronted with issues.  Before arriving at a decision, it is wise and respectful to pay attention and not dismiss another person’s thoughts and feelings, and seek to put oneself in the other person’s shoes.  We should adopt this habit of listening with understanding and empathy in all aspects of our lives, and not just during academic lessons or interactions with others.  One upcoming school event in which we can exercise empathy would be the upcoming Walk-for-a-Cause for the National Kidney Foundation – as we learn more about and empathise with the struggles, it is my hope that you will find greater meaning in the VIA and the Walk-for-a-Cause, and share your reflections with your family members and friends.
