Dear Gessians,

All the best to those who are collecting their results on 17 Dec 2021.  

As part of the Safe Management Measures, please note that only Sec 4NA and 4NT students will be allowed to enter the school to collect their results. They will be expected to observe the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) put in place.

Do report to your classrooms by 1.45 pm in full school uniform and adhere to the guidelines for appropriate appearance stipulated in the GESS student handbook.

School candidates issued the Ministry of Health’s Health Risk Warning will be allowed to collect their results in person if they test negative using the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) on the day of the results release. Kindly do the ART test at home before coming to school.

School candidates who are unwell or are required to self-isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test result should not return to school to collect their results. These students may check their results online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal at [www.seab.gov.sg](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seab.gov.sg%2F&h=AT0WCO25YUe765fXFpoLloBZ14xcfvAVBs1_sdb3DzYdBHbUFLRK_qIeOfuGR5arLjM72u-E0LXoc4EcicPjhWEWW_NiTTDrvXIzCEgmRvhjQX4A_68bzRq0qxFrMypJycXXC7BBs2yGeZlgOrHXyg4xITLOXY-JWDYX6Y0sXqsSidiXzKdaIkeR6l_tKgg0YOMhgl7GOBPl4--7kvmJdG0IYszttizizrLm2MVQP8WbRI-AetbqhzFJLrcsMU2MGsVxeldREO3-_-fQ3npNOJ3qf0rLa7mTmJp5QRRYC1ymzYYZwC7jCIDcqBwhKS13OC5hJgoNZiiMeEM733eoi2p_cJWoL3IiTob80hVE6PxdgoYdVhp6dB1FS2uAHvK7ha2KH5WaCLENXHrbwMvpAxwEqqYddTIgAaiUwB2l8k8hiVHRDGGyZ7KohN2bUJGiNF7IY4riUqarrn0SBnezCsKHJOaPems8sv50H9mp5Ou922p9yctpONubeHOg0eJ_s_-zJswWqp4xbV1kOtty3ljyZaDIZDx4jzohSn3DYwq40O5Z1pj54ZdVUJ95uXIm7vDwj2gQr8RmUK3vi0ae1Isk8Q) from 3.15pm on 17 December 2021.
