<p>Dear Gessians,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the best to those who are collecting their results on 11 Jan 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do report at the school hall by 1.30 pm in full school uniform and adhere to the guidelines for appropriate appearance stipulated in the GESS Student Handbook.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>School candidates who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to school to collect their results. Those who are unable to collect their results in person can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. School candidates may contact the school for assistance if they are unable to appoint a proxy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Onward Gessians!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>School Management Team</p>
