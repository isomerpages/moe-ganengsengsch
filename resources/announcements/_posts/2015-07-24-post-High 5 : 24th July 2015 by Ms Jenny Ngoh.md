Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, Colleagues and Gessians, we celebrated Racial Harmony Day this week with harmony messages on each morning and I believed many of you have played the traditional games during your respective recesses. I hope you also enjoyed the traditional biscuits prepared for you when you managed to win our game station masters. I enjoyed a lot especially when many of you grabbed your friends and challenged me in the traditional games. To name a few, Jasmine Tan (4B), Marcus Chee (4B), Robert (4D) and Jun Yi (4G) from sec 4, I like the perseverance that you have shown. And Cheong Cheng Kang from 1A beat me in the game with just one try.

All of us also have come together to decorate handprints which are shown here. The heart shape is made up of 50 decorated handprints from 33 classes, 16 CCAs and staff. The theme for Racial Harmony Day this year is Harmony in our hands, and we see all of us regardless of our colours, come together to learn, play and have fun. This display would be put at the Celebrating the Good wall which is near the Speakers’ Corner till end of August. I would like to encourage you to drop by to take a look at the handprints which we have contributed. Racial Harmony is something that we should not take for granted in GESS and in Singapore. Let us celebrate what we have and affirm our desire to continue living in harmony as we are all part of one family.

As we celebrate Racial Harmony Day, we are also having our Sports Fiesta today. I got to know from a PE teacher that one of our students had put in a lot of effort to train for the Cross Country Run which was held earlier this year. This student was sharing with a group of students in the Refresh Program that he trained really hard for the run and in the course of the training sessions, he lost a lot of weight. Finally, with his hard work and perseverance, he managed to get a medal during this year’s cross country run. This student is Aung Myin Oo from Sec 4F. To us, Myin Oo has demonstrated one of the Olympic values- Excellence.

For me, excellence is being able to put in your best effort in what you plan to achieve, no matter how difficult it is, till you reached your goal. In case you might not know, the 3 Olympic values are Excellence, Friendship and Respect. Hence Gessians, let’s encourage each other to put in our personal best, to play well and to play fair. Have an enjoyable sports fiesta.

Thank you.
