Dear parents, the schedule for HBL from 13 to 17 April 2020 (Monday to Friday) is attached below, and sorted according to your child(ren)’s class(es).

We have imposed a temporary suspension on all lessons conducted using videoconferencing platforms on 13-14 April (Monday to Tuesday). This is a necessary precaution, to give our teachers time to finetune their videoconferencing practices in line with MOE’s recently-published security protocol on this matter.

We assure you that, just as during normal curriculum hours, our teachers remain committed to fostering a safe learning environment for your child(ren).

Should your child(ren)’s lessons be affected, his/her subject teacher will make the necessary alternative arrangements and communicate them to him/her.

Thank you.
