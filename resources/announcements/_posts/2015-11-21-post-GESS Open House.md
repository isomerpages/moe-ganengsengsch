Our school held its annual Open House on 21 Nov 2015 providing information to prospective students and their parents on the Gessian brand of education through the various academic and CCA booths set-up. Our new MP for Tanjong Pagar, Ms Joan Pereira, dropped by and appreciate our Open House, as well as meeting the schoolâ€™s partners and KP. Ever ONWARD!
