Dear Parents/Guardians of Gessians,

Learning Journey (LJ) to Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)

Land is a precious resource for Singapore. As a small city state, city planning is therefore essential to ensure that we remain competitive.

At the end of the LJ, all participants will be able to:

*   realise our constraints and challenges
*   retain and enhance a sense of identity to keep social and cultural memories alive
*   the elements of urban design
*   Work with your child to expand his/her knowledge to think critically on the cause-effect- solution of an issue (city planning) and its cost-benefit analysis.

Details of the LJ are as follows:  
(i) Date : Saturday, 24 February 2018  
(ii) Time : 11.00 a.m. to 1p.m.  
(iii) Venue : Meet @ School Foyer @ 11.00am  
(v) Cost : Free1- Way Transport to URA will be provided  
(vi) Vacancies : First 18 Reply slips received. Each slip is for a set of parent-child participants. Total â€“ 18 parent & 18 child

You must bring along your child for this LJ to enhance his knowledge of Humanities (Geography, History and National Education). The URA exhibition areas will be closed from March 2018 for renovation till end of this year.

If you are able to attend, please collect the Reply Slip from the General Office and return the Reply slip to our General Office by 12 February 2018.

We look forward to seeing all of you.

Yours faithfully,

Mdm Foo Lee Lian
