Dear parents/guardians,

I hope that you would find this ((BROKENLINK))[CCA training schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nvvSZPL919Og-MwoxUXyGh-Y5tr1_tPU0N30qVZBAX0/edit?usp=sharing) for the month of June useful. CCA is a platform that we develop your child’s character; we hope that he/she will learn and develop through the activities that have been planned by the teachers.

Please note that there may be changes to the schedule from time to time, due to coaches’ availability, facilities issues, competition schedule and/or other issues.

If your child has been away from CCA training due to overseas holiday or other reasons, you may want to advise her to check with her CCA mates, leaders or teacher-in-charge for any changes in the schedule.

Please contact me through office **6474 5594** or email **goh\_chuan\_hwee@moe.edu.sg** if you need further help or clarifications.

**Mr Goh Chuan Hwee**  
**HOD/ PE & CCA**  
**3-May-16**
