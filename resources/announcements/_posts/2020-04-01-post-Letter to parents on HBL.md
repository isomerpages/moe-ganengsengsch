Dear parents/guardians,

In light of the developing COVID-19 situation in Singapore, we have put in place strict precautionary measures over the past two months to keep our school a safe environment for our students, and to allow our students to continue learning.  From 30 March onwards. School has put in place staggered dismissal time. From April 2020, all MOE schools will implement one day of Home-Based Learning (HBL) a week. This will help us prepare for an extended period of HBL should the need arise, so that our students can continue with their learning. GESS will be conducting HBL on Thursday, 2 Apr 2020. Please read attached letter for further details.

Thank you.
