Good morning, Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Chung, fellow colleagues and all Gessians.

Let me start off by sharing what was once written by an American author, Ursula K. Le Guin. She said “the only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty, not knowing what comes next”. Yes, indeed, this is a VUCA world – it’s all about volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.

In saying that, how can we make sure we survive in this VUCA world? We need to be flexible thinkers! This is highlighted as one of the 16 Habits of Mind. To recap, the understanding and application of Habits of Mind serve to provide us with skills to work through real life situations that equip ourselves to respond using awareness, thought and intentional strategy in order to gain a positive outcome.

So, what is meant by thinking flexibly? It is the ability to:  
1\. change perspective  
2\. consider the input of others  
3\. generate alternatives  
4\. weigh options

Number 1. Change perspective. Ask yourself: Do you always see the glass half empty or do you see the glass half full? Remember, any particular situation could be a cause for optimism (half full) or pessimism (half empty). Take the Walk-for-a-Cause activity later as an example. Although I’m sure most of you are positive about Walk-for-a-Cause, perhaps a small group of you may be feeling differently. Maybe it’s due to stress when it comes to speaking to strangers or maybe it’s due to the lack of self-confidence because you don’t believe you can make a significant difference. Now, let’s change that perspective. Do know that for every member of the public we share on kidney health, it is kidney health made aware to one more person? And when this person shares with others on social media, it is more people made aware. Imagine that domino effect. We should do our best to do good in the time we live, to spread goodness and light to others. So, encourage your heart.

Number 2. Consider the input of others. Do you know that the human brain is able to “rewire,” change, and even repair itself to become smarter? People have the capacity to change their minds as they receive additional information, new data or even reasoning that contradicts their beliefs. So, listen to what others have got to say because with the additional data or input from others, your mind will be able to “rewire” or change its thinking to adapt to the situation.

Number 3. Generate alternatives. Flexible people know that they have and can develop options and alternatives. As you face problems in approaching members of the public during Walk-for-a-Cause later, think of alternative ways to approach. Maybe a smile can work wonders or maybe offering help first will do it or maybe speaking the language he/she is fluent in is the way. Try out all possible alternatives as they deem fit. It’s all about trial and error. Even the best solution needs changing from time to time, depending on the various situations that are forever changing. Quoting an organisational theorist, Dr Robert Anthony, “If you find a good solution and become attached to it, the solution may become your next problem.”

Number 4. Weigh options. Think carefully about the possibilities or choices available in both macrocentric and microcentric ways. In a macrocentric way, we need to have a bird’s eye view of the situation. It is usually intuitive, holistic and conceptual while in a microcentric manner, we examine based on a worm’s eye view on the individual and minute parts that make up the whole situation, focusing on the logical and analytical aspects that require attention to detail and precision.

In summary, if we are able to think flexibly, we will be able to face any adversity with confidence. This is because the flexible mind would know when to shift between and among all the volatilities, uncertainties, complexities and ambiguities that come with the situation.

So Gessians, remember, the next time you are faced with different kinds of changes, embrace them with a flexible mind. Well, like Anne Blair, an American historian, once said “Change is fun and exciting, and like a haircut, looks funny at first; but once you get used to it, it’s great!”

Last but not the very least, have a great Founder’s Day ahead! Thank you!
