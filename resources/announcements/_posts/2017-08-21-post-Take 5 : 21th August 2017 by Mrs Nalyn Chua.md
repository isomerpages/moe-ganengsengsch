Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Chung, colleagues and all gessians. Before starting off todays Take Five, I would like to give a very simple sharing about myself.

I was a student who get bored very easily. Eyes glazed over and minds drifted off. It is so difficult for me to pay attention during lessons and all these were resulted from the long hours that I have spent in school. I believe some of you here will agree with me.

It was only when I was in sec 3, when I started to push myself to think about what and where I would really want to be after I graduate and what do I really want to achieve at the end of the day…. Well, and that leads me to where I am now.

Actually I have never thought of myself becoming a teacher standing in front of you here. Instead, I wanted to become a dentist because I am always very fascinated with the different tools and equipment that a dentist will use…. Even today.

I am grateful for 2 important attributes which I endear myself to for the different seasons in life.

**1) Quality of RESILIENCE / perseverance**

Perseverance is a rare quality, especially in these days where we have become accustomed to instant gratification. Like you, back in those days, I remember having to juggle between studies, CCA and duties in prefectorial board which was really tough, especially when examinations are round the corner. But I know deep down, there is a deep sense of purpose to accomplish what I was tasked to do. Abraham Lincoln once said, Always bear in mind that your resolution to succeed is more important than any other thing”.

With this hope and conviction to pull through the challenges, I made it.

But all these would not have materialised if not for a group of teachers’ unswerving dedication towards my learning back then. Do remember to acknowledge your teachers in the midst who have nurtured your head and your heart especially.

**2) State of Humility**

I would like to encourage all fellow gessians to constantly stay faithful and devoted to what we are each called to do.

_“If you are humble, nothing will touch you, neither praise nor disgrace, because you know what you are; and if you are blamed, you won’t be discouraged.”_

It is inevitable in human nature to defend our pride but do remember that we should not be discouraged when the going gets tough or when we are being reprimanded, because this shapes us to be people of character.

So, to the sec 4 and 5 students taking your prelim papers today, please stay Calm and have Patience when you are doing the paper. I wish you all the best!
