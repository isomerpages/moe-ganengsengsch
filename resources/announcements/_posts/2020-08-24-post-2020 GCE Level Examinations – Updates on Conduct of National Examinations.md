2020 GCE N(A)/N(T) / O / A-Level Examinations – Updates on Guidelines and Precautionary Measures on Conduct of National Examinations
====================================================================================================================================

Dear parents and students,

To safeguard the well-being of candidates and teachers and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, safe management measures will be implemented in schools during the national examinations.

The following groups of candidates will not be allowed to sit for the national examinations due to potential public health risks:

*   Confirmed case of Covid-19 Infection;
*   On Quarantine Order;
*   On Stay Home Notice;
*   On Leave of Absence (Confirmed); and
*   Display flu-like symptoms (such as fever or coughing) on the day of examinations.

Specific groups of candidates will be allowed to sit for the national examinations if they have been tested negative for COVID-19.  Enhanced safe management measures will be implemented for this group.
