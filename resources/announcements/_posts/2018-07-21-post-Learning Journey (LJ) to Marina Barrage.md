Dear Parents/Guardians of Gessians,

**Learning Journey (LJ) to Marina Barrage**

Water is a precious resource for Singapore. Water scarcity has been one of our greatest challenges. This LJ will provide an insight to how Singapore has managed our water supply and won international accolade for our efforts in trying to be self-sufficient in water supply by 2061. Flood control is another challenge.

At the end of the LJ, all participants will be able to:  
• realise our constraints and challenges  
• learn the various strategies used to reach self-sufficiency in our water supply to meet the its continual increase in demand and control flood.  
• work with your child to expand his/her knowledge to think critically on the cause-effect-solution of an issue (water management and flood control) and its cost-benefit analysis.
