Dear parents, following NEA’s 7pm forecast that the 24-hour PSI for 25 September is in the mid to high section of the ‘Very Unhealthy’ range and may enter the low end of the hazardous range, MOE, in consultation with MOH, has made the decision to close all primary and secondary schools tomorrow, on 25 September 2015.  Lessons will be suspended.

The well-being of our students remains our priority. Parents who are unable to make alternative care arrangements may continue to send their children to school and teachers will supervise them. Sufficient Enclosed Indoor Spaces will be made available in school.

The Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level music and higher music practical examinations scheduled for tomorrow will be rescheduled to Tuesday, 29 September, 8am.

All Junior Colleges, Centralised Institute and Post-Secondary Education Institutes (PSEIs), namely the Autonomous Universities, Polytechnics and ITE, will remain open.

MOE and GESS will continue to monitor the well-being of the students and staff closely and adopt the necessary mitigation measures based on MOH’s health advisory, such as scaling down or ceasing all outdoor and indoor physical activities.

Please refer to MOE’s press release for more details.
