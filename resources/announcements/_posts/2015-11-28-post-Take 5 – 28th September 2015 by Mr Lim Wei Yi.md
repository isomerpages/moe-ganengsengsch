Good morning Madam Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, teachers and Gessians.

For today’s Take 5, I would like to start with a story that some of you may already be familiar with.

One day a farmer’s donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn’t worth it to retrieve the donkey.

He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him cover up the well. They all grabbed a shovel and begin to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone’s amazement he quietened down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw. With every shovel of dirt that fell on his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer’s neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and totted off!

The moral of this story is this: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick is too not to get bogged down by it. We can get out of the deepest wells by not stopping. And by never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!

Some people may dismiss this story as merely a fable. But we must not forget that there are real life examples of resilience too. For those studying History, this example might be recognisable.

I have personally acknowledged the importance of resilience. For the classes that I go into, you might have caught a glimpse of the motivational poster I have as my desktop wallpaper. The poster is actually a quote from the CEO, Cave Johnson, of the science research company, Aperture Science Industries. He had a unique take on the phrase: When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. He believed that, to make lemonade from life’s lemons is to simply give up and accept the obstacles that come your way. So, he thought that one should instead fight back. To quote, he insisted that ‘when life gives you lemons, don’t make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Demand to see life’s manager. Make life rue the day it thought it could give me lemons.’

I would like to share an instance of resilience witnessed by our Education Minister Mr Heng Swee Keat last Friday, when all primary and secondary schools were closed.  Mr Heng visited Gan Eng Seng Primary School to find out how it was coping with the school closure.  Several students were in school because their parents were unable to make alternative care arrangements.  One lower primary student said there was nothing to be scared of, whilst his friends added “It’s just a haze.  Stay inside.  Close your windows.  There are safety tips on the news.”  Mr Heng praised these students for being “tough cookies” and for demonstrating resilience.

Last Friday was supposed to be Graduation Day for our Sec 4 and 5 students.  Because of school closure, it has been postponed to this afternoon.  To all Sec 4 and 5 students: all the best as you prepare for your exams and as you write a new chapter of your life thereafter.  May you continue to demonstrate resilience and throw back the lemons you encounter with calmness, wisdom and grace.

Thank you.
