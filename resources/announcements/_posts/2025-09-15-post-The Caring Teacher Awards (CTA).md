<p>The Caring Teacher Awards (CTA) celebrate educators who exemplify care
and compassion in their teaching, going beyond the call of duty to nurture
the holistic development of their students. These dedicated teachers play
a vital role in shaping confident, independent, and resilient learners
who contribute meaningfully to our nation. Please consider nominating deserving
GESS teachers through the link provided by 31 December 2025. Thank you
for your taking time to affirm our teachers.</p>
