Dear Parent/Guardian,

We ended semester 1 on a high note with the Annual Cross-Country, Sec 1 learning festival, Sec 3 camp and aesthetics programme for all. It was an enriching and eventful semester made possible only through the support of our key partners like PTA, SAC and GESSOSA.

Please read the attached letter for our achievements, new members and key events and activities for term 3. You may follow us on our Instagram page [https://www.instagram.com/theofficialgess/](https://www.instagram.com/theofficialgess/) or facebook [https://www.facebook.com/SG.GESS/](https://www.facebook.com/SG.GESS/) for updates on our achievements and activities.

Regards

Mrs Selva
