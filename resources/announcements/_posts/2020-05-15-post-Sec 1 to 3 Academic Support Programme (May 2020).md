Dear Parents/ Guardians,

We recognise that with the Full Home Based Learning period and the May holidays, some students in Sec 1-3 classes may need academic support to bridge gaps in their learning. Hence, in line with MOE’s announcement that schools can resume lessons for identified students from 19 May, GESS has set aside week 4 of the May holidays (26 May to 29 May) for your child/ward to return to school for academic support. Please read attached letter for more details.

Regards
