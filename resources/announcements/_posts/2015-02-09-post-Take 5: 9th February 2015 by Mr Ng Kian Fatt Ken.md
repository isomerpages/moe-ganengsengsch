Good Morning Madam Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, Fellow colleagues and Gessians,

This week, we will be commemorating Total Defence Day which falls on Friday 13 February. A quick recap, how many aspects are there in Total Defence and what are they?   There are 5 aspects and they are the Military, Civil, Social, Economy and Psychological Defence.

To many of us, Total Defence Day is just a day of drill, empathising with our forefathers who experienced the days when riots/tragedies happened in Singapore in the 1950’s to the 1970’s (like the Maria Hertogh and Hock Lee Bus incidents, Hotel New World) and making sure that we learn from the past and not let history repeat itself. We are training all able citizens to be prepared for all crises (may it be compulsory for all able bodied male citizens from 18 year old onwards and voluntarily basis) for those who are non-citizens and above 40 year old. We cannot take safety for granted as we are vulnerable, like the terrorists who planned to bomb one of the MRT stations and other strategic places  in Singapore just after the September 11 incident. We were well prepared and arrested these terrorists before they could execute their plans (Military & Psychological).

As Singaporeans, we should be prepared to not just defend our country but also to lend a helping hand to neighbouring countries that face difficulties/tragedies, e.g. earthquakes, plane crashes, floods and other natural calamities.  During such times, Singapore has helped these devastated countries, by donating aid in cash and in kind, and by sending in  professionals like architects, town planners, doctors, medics, soldiers. These people helped the countries to re-build what they have lost. Non-profit organisations like the Lion Befriender, banks and others are also sending humanitarian aids to these countries to show their neighbourliness (Civil, Social and Economy).

We are also taught to be compassionate, generous and help one another regardless of time and place.

Gan Eng Seng School has been incorporating the 5 aspects of Total Defence in its curriculum and co-curriculum activities. The school is always preparing and moulding its students like in the school’s motto: ONWARD!

I will leave you a quote by John F. Kennedy and take a deep thought of this quote:

“Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.”
