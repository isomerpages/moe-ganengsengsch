Dear Gessians,

All the best to those who are collecting their results on 19 Dec 2022.  

Do report to school’s hall by 1.45 pm in full school uniform and adhere to the guidelines for appropriate appearance stipulated in the GESS student handbook.

School candidates who are unwell or self-isolating due to being tested positive for COVID-19 should not return to school to collect their results. These students may check their results online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board's (SEAB) Candidates Portal ([https://myexams.seab.gov.sg](https://myexams.seab.gov.sg/)) from 19 December 2022, 2.45pm.

Onward Gessians!
