Good morning, Mdm Tan and Mr Lee. Good morning, teachers and all Gessians.

In the past several decades, a great deal has changed; the 21st century has been dubbed the ‘information age’. There has been an exponential increase in data and information, and technology has made it available, in raw and unedited forms, in a wide range of media.

Gessians, today I am sharing with you some form of data that you as a students can self-monitor, that can improve your self-discipline. This can help you to establish positive behavior, you can eventually perform well in your coming academic assessment. Student self-monitoring is an effective tool for behaviour change. Self-monitoring is sometimes described as having ‘reactive’ effects, because students who measure and pay close attention to selected behaviours, and often react to the analysis of data by changing their behaviour in order to achieve certain outcomes. When you realise how you have come, or how far you have to go, you will be able to adjust your speed and strategies more effectively.

Now I will share these data/action that the Gessians can display in the classroom setting. Everyone please pen down the following:

Actions for self-monitoring on positive behaviours:

• Focusing on the task or assignment (on-task).  
• Be positive. Making positive statements to peers.  
• Completing your homework regularly and learning from feedback.  
• Complying with teacher requests.  
• Prepare before each lesson. Reading pages of relevant chapter/text before lesson.  
• Requesting teacher assistance if necessary.

Similarly, try to avoid these negative behaviours:

• Excessive talking with peers, not paying attention to what the teacher is saying.  
• Leaving your seat, moving around with a lack of focus.  
• Grandstanding-monopolizes a discussions with no relevance to current lesson content.

Hence, we would like to see more positive actions in your class.

Sometime next month the release of the 2016 GCE O level MT results will take place, students must realize that MT is the only subject that allows you to have a second chance to achieve your target in the same year, which for some of you means that MT allows you to make up your mistake or rectify the mistake, hence for most of you should cherish this second chance to do well. Indeed that all of you will need at 5 to 6 different subjects for your post education options. May I urge every one of you to remember this:

**_“If you don’t go after what you want, you’ll never have it. If you don’t ask, the answer is always no. If you don’t step forward, you’re always in the same place.”_ ~ Nora Roberts**

You may never know what results come of your action, but if you do nothing there will be no result. So, do start to ‘TAKE ACTION’ now. Gessians, may I wish all of you another fruitful day in school and a meaningful and memorable weekend ahead.

ONWARD GESSIANS!
