Good morning school and welcome to the first week of February 2015 – a week which holds two key events in our school calendar – namely the Sec 1 GESS Camp and E-Learning for the Sec 2 to 5. For the Sec 1s, it would be an opportunity for you to discover more about yourself and build better bonds with your classmates while for the Sec 2 to 5s, E-Learning is a chance to develop your self-discipline, adaptability to learn in a different environment and 21st century competencies.

I would like all of you to now take down the following five statements which I am going to share, that I hope you will remember after either your GESS Camp or E-Learning experience:

*   **“Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.”**

Each and every one of you has your own strengths. Discover what you are good at during the GESS Camp, be it the ability to lead, come up with creative ideas or even make people laugh, and use them to help you lead a fuller and fulfilling life, both in and out of school.

*   **“TEAM stands for Together Everyone Achieves More.”**

The GESS Camp will provide an excellent platform for all of you to work as a class with all the team bonding activities. Ride on that opportunity and see for yourself what you can achieve when everyone cooperates and strives as one.

*   **“Rule your mind or it will rule you.”**

For those doing E-Learning, remember you are supposed to observe strictly the timings and regulations briefed to you for the exercise.  Do not succumb to the temptation of waking up late or going off task when you are supposed to be attentively doing an online lesson.

*   **“Take life as it is, not what it ought to be.”**

Remember we do E-Learning so that we are prepared to continue education even when unforeseen circumstances strike and the school needs to be closed. In life, when we come across changes that we cannot avoid, learn to adapt and accept alternatives and make the best out of these changes.

*   **“Embrace, not abuse technology.”**

Technology has allowed us to do many wonderful things including E-Learning from the comfort of your own home. However, if we use technology without wisdom or prudence, e.g. cyber-addiction and cyber-bullying, our best friend may end up becoming our worst enemy.

I hope the five statements I have shared today will provide you with some things to reflect about for the week. Have a fruitful GESS Camp or E-Learning ahead!

Thank you.
