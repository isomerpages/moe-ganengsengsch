Dear Parents/Guardians,

Thank you for your unwavering support given to school during Full Home based learning.  We recognise that with the Full Home Based Learning period and the May holidays, students in the graduating classes may be getting anxious about their preparation for the June MTL papers, coursework subjects and year-end national examinations. Hence, in line with MOE’s announcement that schools can resume lessons for graduating classes from 19 May, GESS has set aside weeks 3 and 4 of the May holidays for graduating students to return to school for academic support. Please read the attached letter. We look forward to seeing your child/ward in school soon.

Regards
