I am Anisah from 4H. In these 4 years in GESS, I am glad to be given opportunities to take part and also celebrate Racial Harmony Day activities. These activities raised my awareness of the traditions and customs practised by other races. Being Indian, I do not use chop sticks to eat. So in 2013 where I had to pick up the rice crackers with a pair of wooden chopstick for eating was quite a challenge for me. Through CCE lessons, I learnt the absence of consideration for another’s cultural practices can lead to racial violence. Traditional games like 5 stones and pick up sticks, which we play every year during Sports Fiesta, might seem simple and are for children. Actually I find these games have a lot to teach us about the kampong spirit. I like to think that my understanding of what racial harmony is has increased over the last four years. It is only through continuous engagement and sharing that we minimise racial misunderstanding and conflicts. I am glad to have friends from different races and cultures. They are integral to my identity and growth as an Indian Singaporean. Thank you.
