Dear Parents/Guardians of Gessians,

**Learning Journey (LJ) to Electricity Efficiency Centre(EEC) @PSA Building**

Electricity is essential for all homes and industries. Its conservation is important to reduce our utility bill and reduce carbon footprint.

This family bonding LJ will provide an insight on how to  
• use electricity optimally (energy saving tips)  
• read the home electricity meters easily  
• calculate electricity consumption of electrical appliances (Home energy audit)  
• understand electric vehicles, home automation system, green buildings and alternate sources of energy

Details of the LJ and a Reply Slip can be found [HERE](/files/PTA-Letter-EEC.pdf)

Please submit your Reply Slip through your child to Mdm Foo Lee Lian by **20 Sept. 2017**

We look forward to seeing all of you.
