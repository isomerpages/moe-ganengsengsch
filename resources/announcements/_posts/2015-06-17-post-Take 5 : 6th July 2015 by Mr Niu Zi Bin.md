Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, Teachers and All Gessians,  
Today I am going to share with you a story about Vision.

Despite losing his vision at age 13, Erik Weihenmayer became a celebrated and accomplished athlete. Redefining what it means to be blind, Erik has transformed the image of blindness and opened the minds of people around the world as an athlete, an adventurer and a motivational speaker.

How did he manage to accomplish so much despite his visual handicap?

Erik was first introduced to rock climbing at a camp for blind teenagers. At the earliest opportunity, he embarked on a mountaineering career. He continued setting new challenges for himself. After climbing the tallest mountains in South America and Africa, he set his sights on Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. On May 25, 2001, Erik stood atop the 29,035-foot peak as the first blind person to summit Everest. On Sept. 5, 2002, at age 34, Erik became one of fewer than 100 individuals to climb all of the Seven Summits—the highest peak on each of the seven continents.

Erik continues to climb today, and more importantly, he demonstrates to others that even a challenge as serious as blindness does not have to be a limitation. He enjoys rock climbing, alpine skiing and whitewater kayaking. He never allows his blindness to interfere with his passion for an exhilarating and fulfilling life.

He helps blind people to adopt a “no barriers” mindset that lets them move forward with their lives. Most of all, however, Erik shows the importance of identifying what we want to achieve, and not giving up until we reach our goals.

”Success is not just the crowning moment, the spiking of the ball in the end zone or the raising of the flag on the summit. It is the whole process of reaching for a goal, and sometimes it begins with failure.” Erik Weihenmayer

Even as we celebrate SG50, what is your Vision for your future and your Vision for our country in the next 50 years?

Finally, I wish all the graduating students success in your oral examinations in the weeks ahead.

Onward!
