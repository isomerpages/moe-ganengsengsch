Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, colleagues and all Gessians. This week marks an important milestone for our upper secondary students as the Sec 4 students will step down from their leadership roles in their respective CCAs, and pass it on to the Sec 3 students.

I would like to start my Take5 by sharing with you a short story about ‘The Two Wolves’.

An old leader of a Native American Tribe was teaching his grandchildren about life. He said, “A battle is raging inside me… it is a terrible fight between two wolves. One wolf represents fear, anger, envy, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, false pride, superiority and ego. The other stands for joy, peace, love, hope, humility, kindness, friendship, empathy, compassion and faith.”

The old man looked at the children with a firm stare. “This same fight is going on inside you, and inside every other person, too.”

They thought about it for a minute, and then one child asked his grandfather, “Which wolf will win?”

The old man replied: “The one you feed.”

For our Sec 3 students who will be assuming the role as CCA leaders, I would like to remind you that you will definitely face multiple challenges during your leadership term. For example, there may be times a training session don’t turn out the way you want it to. The way you had planned it to be. In such a situation, are you one who would put the blame on yourself, thinking that it is you who had not done enough, or that you are not good enough? I hope not.

Instead, I hope that you will adopt the growth mindset and think of every challenge as an opportunity to grow yourself into a capable leader. Speak to your seniors, your peers or your teachers. Whatever you do, don’t give in to negativity, and never ever give up. The famous American actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, once said, “Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength”.

So Gessians, which wolf will you feed?

Thank you.
