Good morning, Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, colleagues and Gessians,

Today I am going to share with you a story that I came across online, a story of a blind girl.

There was a blind girl who hated herself just because she was blind. She hated everyone, except her loving boyfriend. He was always there for her. She said that if only she could see the world, she would marry her boyfriend.

One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her and then she could see everything, including her boyfriend. Her boyfriend asked her, “now that you can see the world, will you marry me?”

The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was blind too, and refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying: “Just take care of my eyes dear.”

This is how the human brain changes when the status changed. Only few would remember what life was before, and who’s always been there even in the most painful situations.

As we celebrate our country’s golden jubilee this month, let us not be ignorant of the unfortunate happenings in other places, be it the Indonesian plane crash, explosion in Tianjin, China or Bangkok bomb blast and the many lives lost and people hurting.

As we begin this new week, let us be reminded that Life Is A Gift.

Today before you think of saying an unkind word – think of someone who can’t speak.

Before you complain about the taste of your food – think of someone who has nothing to eat.

Today before you complain about life – think of someone (or many others) who passed away too early.

Before you argue about your dirty classroom, and he/she who didn’t do his duty,  
think of the people who are living in the streets.

Before whining about the distance you travel or our public transport– think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet.

And when you are tired and complain about your work–think of the unemployed, the disabled and those who wished they had your job.

But before you think of pointing the finger or condemning another – remember that none of us is perfect.

And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down – put a smile on your face and be grateful that you’re alive and still around.

To our dear Secondary 4s and 5s who will sit for their Preliminary exam this week,  please remember that your family, teachers and friends are all rooting for you as you work hard during this period. We believe that you will do your very best and we look forward to celebrating the fruits of your labour.

Remember Life is a gift – Live it, Enjoy it, Celebrate it, and Fulfill it.

Thank you.
