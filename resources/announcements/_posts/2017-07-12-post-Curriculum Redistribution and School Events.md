Dear Parents/Guardians

In our last letter dated 25 May 2016 we highlighted two dates where curriculum redistribution will take place:

<table border="1" width="482" style="box-sizing: inherit; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 166px;"><tbody style="box-sizing: inherit;"><tr style="box-sizing: inherit; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><td width="130" style="box-sizing: inherit; padding: 5px 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: bold;">12 Jul (Tue)</strong></td><td width="354" style="box-sizing: inherit; padding: 5px 10px;">Curriculum Redistribution – Implement Monday’s timetable</td><td width="260" style="box-sizing: inherit; padding: 5px 10px;">Students to bring books and material meant for Mondays.</td></tr><tr style="box-sizing: inherit; background: rgb(230, 230, 230);"><td width="130" style="box-sizing: inherit; padding: 5px 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: bold;">4 Aug (Thu)</strong></td><td width="354" style="box-sizing: inherit; padding: 5px 10px;">Curriculum Redistribution – Implement Monday’s timetable</td><td width="260" style="box-sizing: inherit; padding: 5px 10px;">Students to bring books and material meant for Mondays.</td></tr></tbody></table>

On both of these dates, the school will follow the usual timetables for Mondays. Therefore, all students will report at 8.15am for reading on 12 July and 4 August 2016. They will follow their Monday timetables, and attend any after-school programmes normally scheduled on Mondays. As such, there will not be any CCA training on both of these dates.

We would also like to invite you to join us in two upcoming school events in Term 3.

On 22 July 2016 (Friday), students and staff will participate in the School Sports Fiesta which feature competitive games and various “1-Minute to Win It” games. The games are designed to encourage an active lifestyle amongst students and staff through fun and teamwork. All students will report at 7.15am for silent reading, followed by the Sports Fiesta, and will be dismissed by 12.50pm.

On 8 August 2016 (Monday), all students will report at 7.15am for silent reading, followed by the National Day celebrations, consisting of the National Day Observance Ceremony, parade by our uniformed CCAs, and performances put up by our performing arts CCA. Students would be dismissed by 10.30am.

You may contact your child’s/ward’s Form Teachers if you need further clarification.

Thank you.  
Onward!

Yours faithfully

Mdm Jenny Tan  
Principal
