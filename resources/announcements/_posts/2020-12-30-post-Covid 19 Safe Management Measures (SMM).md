Dear Gessians,

Please see the attached document for Covid-19 Safe Management Measures (SMM) implemented in GESS.

You must read and understand the document thoroughly before reporting to school on 4 January 2021 (Monday). It contains important rules and processes that all students must be familiar with when you go about your different activities in school.

Thank you for working with the school to make GESS a safe learning and working environment for all staff and students.
