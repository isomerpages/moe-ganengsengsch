Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, colleagues and all Gessians.

I will be presenting to you this week’s High Five.

Let me start this week’s High Five by asking you to pause and ask yourself, “Think of an act of kindness that you have done recently. It may be something as simple as helping your friends to collect their homework when they were unwell or sweeping the classroom during your recess or probably, helping an elderly to cross the road. What were your feelings after doing that good deed?

I would like to share a recent act of kindness done by a Gessian. He was commended by a member of the public recently as he had voluntarily come and helped in a charity drive on a Friday night on 27 March from 10.30 pm till 4 am near the Parliament House. Despite it was the wee hours into the night, he had the well-being of the people at heart and stayed awake to distribute buns and drinks to those people who were queuing to pay their respect for our Singapore founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He had demonstrated the good values of care and respect in his selfless act. His name is Tan Xiao Wei from class 3B. _May I invite Tan Xiao Wei to stand up? Shall we give him a round of applause for the good deed which he has done”?_

I would also like to take this opportunity to invite Pau Sian Tawi to stand up.  Tawi was seen cleaning up the clogged sinks in the male toilet at his own initiatives during the GESS Camp last term. This selfless act was seen by his peers and they were definitely touched by his actions. Let us also take this opportunity to give Tawi from Sec 2B a round of applause.

These are some of the good deeds that Gessians had done which I would like to share with all of you. I believe there are many of you out there who have done good deeds to help the others.

As part of GESS 130th anniversary, GESS will be having the blood donation drive on this Saturday, 11th April. I am glad that some of Secondary 5 students here have signed up to donate blood while others have encouraged your parents, relatives  and friends to sign up for this good cause. The intention of this activity is to support a national cause in response to the call for blood donation to save lives in our community. As GESS celebrates our 130th Anniversary this year, we aim to have a minimum of 130 people to donate 1 pack of blood each to the National Blood Bank by the end of the year. Donating blood may seem to be a simple thing to do, but it can make a big difference to the lives of others. Although most of you are not able to donate as you do not meet the minimum age requirement, you can still take this opportunity to encourage others to sign up and donate.

I would also like to take this opportunity to announce that 38 15 years old Gessians were selected by the Ministry of Education to represent the school to take the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). They have spent three and half hours last Tuesday to complete the test assigned to them. I have faith that these 38 Gessians have made our school and our country proud by giving their best in completing the assessments.

This week, we have also witnessed and experienced the Election of Head Prefect. The objective of this election is to educate everyone on the the importance of casting a wise vote and not to be a swing voter. Every staff and student was given the opportunity to vote. We also have some visitors from Queensway Secondary School who came down to learn the process on conducting the election. I am certain that all of you have taken your vote seriously.

Before I end of my High Five, I hope that all of you will continue to know the good, desire the good and do the good. Always remember that a simple act of kindness or a word of “thank you” does make someone’s day.  Let us all play our part in making our school a better place for everyone. As mentioned by Sally Koch, “Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones surround us every day.” Take that opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others.

Thank you.

Onward!
