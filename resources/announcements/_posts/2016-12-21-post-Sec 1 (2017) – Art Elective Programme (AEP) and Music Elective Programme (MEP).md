To grow the potential and talent of students across a wider range of domains at the secondary level, MOE announced in May 2015 the setting up of AEP and MEP centres from 2016, to cater for students in non-AEP/MEP schools. The secondary level AEP and MEP are four-year programmes. These programmes aim to develop well-rounded leaders who are supportive of the arts, and focus on in-depth and critical learning to deepen students’ conceptual understanding of Art/Music. Students in the AEP/MEP will take Higher Art/Higher Music at O-Level.
