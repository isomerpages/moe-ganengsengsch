Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, teachers and fellow Gessians. My name is Hein Htet Aung from Class 3D and I am one of the candidates running for the position of the 64th Head Prefect. Unlike Jia Xin and Rachel, I only joined the Prefectorial Board last June but the last eight months have provided me with many opportunities, and it is because of those opportunities that I am standing in front of all of you today, delivering my speech.

I believe that every one of us has the potential to make a positive impact on the school and each of us has a different idea of how to improve the school. I want to turn all our ideas into a reality with my actions. As a member of Track and Field, I have experienced and understood the importance and far-reaching consequences of teamwork and encouragement.

As such, I promise that I will work to ensure that everyoneΓÇÖs voice is heard. I will pay attention to your ideas and think of ways to include and integrate them into the school processes. If I am elected, I believe that I have the commitment and ability to represent you and turn this school into the best school for Gessians.

The symbol I have chosen to represent myself is a tree. This is because it is strong and sturdy no matter the conditions. It stands proud and tall in stormy weather and provides shade for people on hot days. A tree is caring and resilient, qualities that I too, posses. I’ll be your go-to-person should you need a listening ear or a second opinion. I’m sure everyone here can relate to this. PSLE, streaming and O-levels, these events are all the stormy weather of our academic journey so far. During PSLE and streaming, I worked hard and displayed resilience throughout by setting goals and striving towards it. These two events can also show how I am determined about getting things done on time, to the best of my abilities.

As I grow as a leader and person, I will seek to model the way and inspire a shared vision. If I am appointed the next Head Prefect, I canΓÇÖt promise you that I will be a perfect person or that the school will suddenly transform into your dream school. However, you have my word that I will be your eyes, ears, voice and heart and try my hardest to be the best Head Prefect I can be.

Thank you!
