Sing aloud:

“There was a time when people said  
That Singapore won’t make it, but we did  
There was a time when troubles seemed too much  
For us to take, but we did  
We built a nation, strong and free, reaching out together  
For peace and harmony”

In the past, people used to say that Singapore would never aspire. But, Singaporeans had faith and we did grow as a nation.

We used to face a lot of problems in the past until it was too much for us, Singaporeans to handle. But in the end, we overcame those challenges and solved all the problems.

We created an independent nation which was very strong and no longer under control of other countries. We, as Singaporeans, aimed as a nation for peace and harmony with everyone.

What does Singapore means to you?

I would like to quote Joel Koo Tze Wei from 5B from his National Education examination:

“I used to pass by the Macdonald house along Bukit Timah road every day before it was torn down. I will always remember that place as I used to go there for breakfast with my family when I was in kindergarten and lower primary.”

Singapore means family to Joel. What about you?

Besides my lovely family in Marine Parade, Gan Eng Seng School is my second home. I come to school daily to meet my fun-loving students and supportive colleagues. I would like to take this opportunity to share 2 recent incidents.

Bryan Leong Zi Yang from 3C makes me feel very proud to be his Elementary Mathematics teacher. With hard work, great effort and support from his classmates, Rong Guan and Yancheng, he improved tremendously, rose up to the challenge and aced his recent Trigonometry class test.  I told the class that this is Bryan Leong’s moment and one of Mr Chee’s proud moments in life too. Well done, Bryan Leong and keep up the good work!

Next, Saying “good morning” to my supportive colleague, Mr Lim Choon Beng is my daily routine in staffroom. Last week I asked him, “How’s your day, Mr Lim?” He replied: “As good as it can be.” As good as it can be, indeed our daily lives in school is as good as it can be. Though we meet challenges in our daily lives in school, we face the obstacles as good as it can be. Mr Lim, thank you very much for being my supportive colleague always.

So, what does Singapore means to me?

**My beloved students, my beloved colleagues, my beloved friends and my lovely family are my Singapore.**

Thank You, Gan Eng Seng School. Onward!
