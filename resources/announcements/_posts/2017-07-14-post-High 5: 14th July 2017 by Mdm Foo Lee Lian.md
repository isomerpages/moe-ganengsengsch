**Habits of the Mind: Gathering Data through all Senses – _Current Affairs_**

Do you know that Singapore, a country, is smaller than most cities in the world like Shanghai and Tokyo?  Foreigners are always impressed with our economic development and how Singapore, without any natural resources can succeed economically and be one of the richest countries in the world in terms of per capita income. However, we are vulnerable to threats internally and externally and we need to know the causes and possible results and take measures to alleviate adverse situations created by these threats.

Remember this Monday, Mr Goh Chuan Hwee shared on the importance of using our senses to be aware of abnormal situations called “Situational Awareness” to identify potential outbreak of crisis/threats like terrorist threat. We have to use our 5 senses to detect possible problems and avert disasters. It is not whether terrorist attack will occur. It is a matter of time that it will occur and if so, what must we do such as through our SG Secure, to prepare Singaporeans to react when we detect or encounter an attack.

We must always be alert of the current affairs around us in order to survive. We can learn from other countries which have experienced terrorist attacks on how to react to save lives and impact our society. When we read and think about the current issues happening in other parts of the world like the recent terrorist attack on London Bridge, we realise how the actions of one had affected the whole community or religious group.

Another internal threat is the shortage of water supply. We know that Singapore depends on Malaysia to sell us water till 2061.  50% of our water supply is from Malaysia. We need therefore to understand the history, causes, effects and possible measures that have been taken and must be taken in order to manage our water supply. We will then be able to understand the reasons behind the actions taken by our government and cooperate with our government to ensure that we can avoid water shortage. We are proud that although we are short of water, we export our water management technology.

We study in Geographical Investigation (GI) Water Supply in Singapore. We learn using all our senses to understand this issue. We use our power of observation to look out for the factors affecting water quality of the canal next to our school. We learn the quality of the water from this canal by measuring the 3 water parameters, namely PH, dissolved oxygen and Turbidity with a water kit. We smell the water and are able to make logical deduction of its water quality too. We capture the factors affecting the water quality in photographs, recording and drawing them. We are involved in collecting data and learn to notice and record changes with our senses.

In the news, we know that enormous disruptions have begun right here, all of us must be ready for jobs “that do not yet exist. The ABCs every one of us needs to learn are vastly different from those of the just a generation ago. We have to be prepared for it. According to Dr Balakrishnan  (Minister-in-charge of Singapore Smart Nation initiative) , “A is for sense of the **_a_**esthetics, because technology has to be designed to be user-centric and people-centric.”  So we have to use our human senses to build this sense of aesthetics. We are love-embodied and principled leaders. We empathise and feel for others.

“B is for an ability to **_b_**uild because humans increasingly need to build both hardware and software to solve a problem and address a need.” We can only do it with collecting data through our senses first before being able to understand rapidly changing human needs. We are GESS Innovative thinkers.

“Lastly, C stands for a mastery of **_c_**ommunication, to bridge the gap between the user and technologist and experts of diverse fields so that they can work together to deliver impactful solutions.” To be able to have this top-notch communication skills, knowledge and understanding must be acquired by collecting data through our senses again as a GESS collaborative learners

Change is the only constant factor and “no one will be doing one single job for the rest of our life.”

Artificial Intelligence and Digitalisatiion is here. What are they? How will they affect us? Read what our PM said in Hamburg, Germany during the G20 Summit.

Next do you know that Singapore is also susceptible to external threats. We must know what is happening in our regions and the world as we are not free from any social, economic or political changes. Singapore is highly dependent on our trade for survival as we have no natural resources as just stated. Practically all our food and goods are imported and we need to export our value-added goods and services in order to make a living. So if any of our trading partners has any internal problem or has an issue with us, we will be affected. Trade will be hindered. Our tourism will be affected as their citizens will not visit us. When TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) was not honoured by USA when President Trump came into power, Singapore will be badly affected in our trade with USA. All the trade agreements under TPP will have to be re-negotiated. It will be harder to export our goods to countries that don’t have trade agreement with us as they will impose import tax on our goods. So our manufacturing sector will suffer a loss in business and our workers will lose their jobs. Our political leaders and businessmen must work harder to get new business deals and trade agreements to favour us. Read, listen and think of the consequences of the collapse of TPP.

Do you know that when China started the One Belt One Route, Singapore is also affected? How are we affected? How will the thawing of ice cap in the North Pole affect Singapore? How will the creation of more ports in Malaysia affect us? What’s AIB? What’s BRICs? Why did our Prime Minister attend the G20 Summit in Hamburg? What if there is a canal cutting through Kra of Isthmus or across Peninsular Malaysia, from Melaka to Kuantan? What if North Korea fire its ICBM? Why?

Therefore, as concerned residents in Singapore, we need to know current affairs around us in the regions and world too. Knowledge and understanding of current affairs are essential for passing a compulsory subject called GP (General Paper) in JC too. Also most employers want their employees at management levels to be interested in current affairs in order to have the right business decision.

Learning of these current affairs can only be derived by observing or taking in through our senses.

We must think critically to weigh the cost and effects and think of all possible outcomes.  We will then use not only our head and hands but also our heart. We must go on to ask questions and continue using all our senses to receive and understand and learn more information. It is a continual never ending cycle.

We need to stay alert to continue to collect data, learn incessantly throughout our life with all our senses, so that we will not be left out, unemployed in rapidly changing world.

Life-long education with knowledge of current affairs, for future skills is essential.  After all, we are what the environment is.

I have spoken, have you learnt? What must you do next? Seeing is different than being told.
