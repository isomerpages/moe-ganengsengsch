Good morning Mdm. Tan, Mr. Lee, Mr. Tan, colleagues and all Gessians,

For this week’s High 5, I will first share with you a short story:

Maharaja Ranjit Singh has been one of the greatest kings in India. Once, he was on tour visiting his kingdom at night, in camouflage. During his visit, a beggar recognised him and bowed before the King to pay his respects. Ranjit Singh, in response, bowed even more before the beggar and gave him a bag full of money.

When Ranjit Singh moved on, out of curiosity, his general asked him, “Sir, you are such a great Maharaja. Why did you bow before that beggar?”

Then Ranjit Singh said, “That beggar was poor and illiterate. Despite this fact, he knew how to pay respect to others; I am much more educated than him, so I should have shown much more respect to him. And that’s exactly what I did.”

Dear Gessians, what can you learn from this story? (Short pause)

For the beggar, he respected his king for being a good ruler in venturing out in the night to observe his people, to show care and concern for them.

For the king, he respected the beggar by showing him the respect due.

As an educated person, we must respect all for who they are. We are not superior to others but are equal. Therefore, we must respect others in order for others to respect us.  
Last thur, 27 August was the GESS Support Staff Day. On that day, our school’s support staff attended an enjoyable and meaningful retreat. I would also like to commend the group of teachers who volunteered to station themselves at the office counter on that day so that the support staff can attend the retreat.

Our support staff are made up of a team of dedicated and helpful people, to ensure that the school’s daily operations run smoothly.

How many of us realise their hard work and appreciate them? How many of you actually say “thank you” to them?

I would like to encourage all of you to show your appreciation to our school support staff. For example, in our school’s general office, when you are going in to draw keys or return any material at the front counter, it is always good manners to great the support staff on duty and thank them for helping you. By returning your own plate and cutlery during recess time will also make our canteen cleaners’ work easier too.

Respect is one of our important core values, knowing the right values but not putting them in action is meaningless. Therefore, start putting values into action TODAY!

I wish all of you a blessed weekend ahead.

Thank you.

ONWARD GESSIANS!
