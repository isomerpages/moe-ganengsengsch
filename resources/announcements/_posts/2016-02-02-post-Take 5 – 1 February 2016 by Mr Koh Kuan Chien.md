Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, colleagues and Gessians.

This Friday, we will be celebrating Chinese New Year to usher in the Year of the Monkey.  I would like to share with you some leadership qualities from a historical figure, who was also born in the year of Monkey.  This person is Julius Caesar.  Born in 100 B.C, this Roman general stood out, not just because of his strategic thinking skills but also because of his vision, wisdom and the effective leadership of his army.  I would like to share several of his traits so that all of us can apply in our quest to be stronger leaders in our lives.

1.  Connection with his soldiers

It was said that Caesar knew the name of each and every soldier fighting with him. That personal connection enabled him to win the confidence of his army. A leader doesn’t need to be “best friends” with every member of his team but personal connection with co-workers strengthens communication and understanding within the team and encourages the team to work harder alongside the leader.

2.  Know and use your tools effectively

Roman soldiers were trained to use _gladius_ –small pointy daggers- with which they conquered half the world. Far from the powerful image of great swords and spears, the legions were specialized in the use of these small weapons, which are light but effective.

Know which tools will make you succeed and learn to use them effectively.  Develop your skills accordingly to maximize your potential and that of the people around you.

3.  Accept responsibility

Caesar was always close to his troops in spite of the danger in doing so. The Roman general wanted to communicate directly with his army because he knew that would boost his soldiers’ morale. Being close to his men also allowed him to identify the weaknesses of his army and make quick decisions to correct mistakes. Like Julius Caesar, a good leader must be ready for contingencies, give support to his people and make quick but well-thought out decisions.

4.  Celebrate achievements

Julius Caesar made sure that everyone knew about his victories, many of which he wrote down and became classical works. You don’t have to write a book like Caesar did, but it is important that you learn to communicate everything you achieve, so that the team will feel that they are part of the journey.

As part of the leadership development plan for every Gessian, Sec 3 students will be having a leadership workshop this Thursday.  As you take on key positions and roles in class and CCAs, I hope you will continue to hone your leadership competencies and aspire to realize stage 3, “School Leadership”, this year.

Thank you.
