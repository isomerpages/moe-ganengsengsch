<p>Dear Gessians,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the best to those who are collecting their results on 10 Jan 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do report at the school hall by 2.10 pm in full school uniform and adhere
to the guidelines for appropriate appearance stipulated in the GESS Student
Handbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who are unable to collect their results in person, they can appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. School
candidates may contact the school for assistance if they are unable to
appoint a proxy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onward Gessians!</p>
