Dear Parents/Guardians,

We are grateful that you have worked hand in hand with us in the implementation of Safe Management Measures so that our school remains a safe and conducive environment for all students. As Singapore moves into Phase 2 of re-opening and we prepare to welcome back all students in school from 29 June, we need the collective effort of all parents and students to exercise social responsibility so that schools stay safe.

We would like to highlight a few key safe management measures that we should all observe:

–              If your child is feeling unwell (e.g. sore throat, fever or cough), please see a doctor and do not come to school. If diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI), students 13 years and above will be prioritised for COVID-19 testing, while students 12 years and below will be assessed by the doctor as to whether a test is required.

–              If there are any adult household members (18 years and above) unwell with flu-like symptoms, inform the school and keep your child at home. Ensure that the unwell adult household member seeks medical treatment promptly.

For students staying at home, please be assured that the school will continue to support them in their learning. Your vigilance and cooperation are important in keeping our schools safe for all.

Thank you for your support and understanding.
