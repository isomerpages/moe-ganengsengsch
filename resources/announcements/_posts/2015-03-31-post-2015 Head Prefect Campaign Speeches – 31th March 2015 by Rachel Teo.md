Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, teachers and fellow Gessians. As many of you know, my name is Rachel and I am from Class 3E, one of the candidates running for this year’s Head Prefect Election.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to share a little more about myself. Today I am here to share with you my journey as a prefect. These one and a half years as a prefect have given me much learning opportunities and the exposure and experiences gained were invaluable. I discovered that I enjoyed and am really good at planning events, especially because I am creative, meticulous and able to relate well to others.

I always try to put myself in another person’s shoes. This is the main reason why I have chosen the Wi-Fi logo as my symbol. I can see some looks of surprise from you. Please allow me to elaborate. Once you are connected to a Wi-Fi network, you are able to surf the internet freely and complete your tasks. As a servant leader, I would want to be your personal Wi-Fi device to connecting with you, to understand your problems. With me around you can confidently share with me your ideas and opinions about school matters and I would be more than glad to listen, understand and take actions whenever possible to assist you. Whenever you are connected to the internet, you can use it for work purposes and of course for other purposes.

So as a disciplined individual, we should know when to do things we are allocated to and be focused instead of getting distracted. The message that I want to bring across is actually very simple, as your personal Wi-Fi network, I am not only here to listen to your problems, but also to be your positive influencer.

To me, a Head Prefect is someone other students would look for whenever they have problems. I consider myself to be an approachable and task-oriented problem-solver, so when faced with problems I will be more than willing to take the initiative to help anyone in need.

If appointed to the role, I will do my best to deliver what I promise, to listen to your concerns and build a school in which we will support one another whenever we encounter difficulties. With that I end my speech. Thank you for your kind attention!
