Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Tan, teachers and fellow Gessians. I am Hein Htet Aung, and I am in the running to become the 64th Head Prefect.

My vision for the perfect Gessian community is one where everyone is able to speak their mind, and contribute ideas that could change the school. I am certain that I can provide just the platform for that. I believe that together, we have the potential to make a positive impact on the school. I know that many of you would like to improve your school experience, and I want to turn our ideas into reality.

As mentioned in my previous speech and presentations, my goal is to ensure that the voices of the student body are heard. I feel strongly about this, as I have observed that opinions expressed during Student Forums are somewhat reserved.

I believe that many of you have good ideas and valuable observations as mentioned in previous Student Forums such as the Dress-down Day and Loan-a-T-shirt. However, you may not feel comfortable speaking your mind even in a class setting. And you don’t have to wait till July’s student forum to speak your mind!

I have two plans in mind that is to have an online suggestion box and a “Pre-Forum Survey” where you can contribute suggestions freely! This will allow you to share your ideas in a more private setting at any time! It will also help improve the structure of our current Student Forum, as well as in the collection of quality responses.

The “Pre-Forum Survey” will establish a more open channel of communication between the student body and school leaders. You will just need to log on to your AsknLearn account to give your suggestions. I have already discussed and confirmed with Mdm Siti that these can be done. The results from the survey will provide a database of ideas that can be built on through our collective efforts.

As your Head Prefect, I pledge to take action where it matters. I am confident I have what it takes to be your Head Prefect, a leader who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way. I am determined to ensure that each of you has a voice. Every idea is a seed, and I will nurture each seed into a tree that will stand firm and strong even in the worst weather conditions. Let’s work towards this common goal of letting everyone play a part in creating what we call, Gan Eng Seng School!

So Htet (take) a stand and vote for me, Htet Aung! Vote for the tree of growth and change that can shelter you from storms.

Thank you for giving me an opportunity to campaign!
