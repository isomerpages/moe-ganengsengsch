Dear parents/guardians,

With the end of Circuit Breaker, we enter the phase of safe opening. The new school term with new arrangements and routines will be a new normal for all for us.

In this issue of Parent Kit, we address your top concerns about Back to School arrangements, and provide tips on how you can guide your child to adjust back to school.

Thank you.
