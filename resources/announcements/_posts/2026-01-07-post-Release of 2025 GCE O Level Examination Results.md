<p>Dear Gessians,</p>
<p></p>
<p>All the best to those who are collecting their results on 14 January 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please report to the School Hall by 1.45 pm in full school uniform and
adhere to the guidelines for appropriate appearance stipulated in the GESS
Student Handbook.</p>
<p>Those who are unable to collect their results in person, they can appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. School
candidates may contact the school for assistance if they are unable to
appoint a proxy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Onward Gessians!</p>
