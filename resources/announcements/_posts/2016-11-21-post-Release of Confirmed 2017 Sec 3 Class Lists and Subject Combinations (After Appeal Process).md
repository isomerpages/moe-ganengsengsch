Dear GESSians,

We are pleased that the class lists for 2017 Sec 3 cohort have been confirmed. We believe that the subject combinations match with your best ability and aptitude based on two criteria i.e. first by merit, followed by choice. We are confident that you have the wisdom to follow good counsel as you prepare for your 2018 National Examination. And truly the work begins this November with your best time management and planning. We wish you all the best for 2017.

ONWARD! GESSians.
