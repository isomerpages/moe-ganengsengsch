Dear Parents/Guardians of Gessians,

**Health Talk on “A Balanced Diet- Ying and Yang Food”**

An imbalance diet is a silent killer in Singapore. It can lead to constipation, diarrhea, poor health and even death. There is an increasing trend of people suffering from ignorance of a proper diet to stay healthy.

This talk will provide an insight on Ying and Yang foods in order to  
• avoid body “heatiness” or “coolness”.  
• classify types of ying and yang food  
• be aware of how and when to eat them

We have invited two TCM practioners, Mr William Chui and Ms Vivian Ong to share their knowledge on “Ying” and “Yang” food for a “Balanced Diet”. Last year, Mr Chui and Ms Ong had shared on how to avoid getting Diabetes. Many parents have requested to invite them to share on Ying and Yang food.

Details of the talks are as follows:  
(i) Date : Saturday, 25 August 2018  
(ii) Time : 1230 hrs to 1400 hrs  
(iii) Venue : School AVA Studio  
(v) Cost : Free  
Light refreshment will be served from 12 noon to 12.30p.m
