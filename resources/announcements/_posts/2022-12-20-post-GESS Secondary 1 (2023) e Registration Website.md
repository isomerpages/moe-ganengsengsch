**<u>(9) Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) Membership</u>**

All parents are automatically members of the GESS PTA. The school will be making a one-time collection of $24.00 based on an annual subscription of $6.00 per year. The amount collected will be used to support school activities like the supervised self-study programme.

Students with older siblings in GESS would only be required to make payment for the remaining years they have left in GESS upon graduation of their older siblings. (e.g. if a parent has an older child in Secondary 4 2022, she will only need to make a payment of $18.00 for the remaining three years in GESS of her younger child, i.e for 2023 to 2025.)

The school hopes to promote greater parent involvement in school activities as well as PTA related matters. Kindly complete the PTA registration form via the link: [https://forms.gle/3pWfEjFh9JqWVeKT7](https://forms.gle/3pWfEjFh9JqWVeKT7)
