Our school had the honour of hosting the management committee and staff of Lam Tai Fai College, Hong Kong, on 30 March 2015, during their visit to Singapore as part of the 2014 – 2015 Singapore Exchange Programme. After our school leaders shared with them the curriculum offered by GESS, the delegation discussed with our key personnel areas of interest such as language education and the use of ICT. They then toured the school campus and sat in Mathematics and Science lessons. The delegation was impressed with our teachers, who, they said, have put in place sound educational practices and possessed strong teaching skills. This visit enhanced the joy of learning across national boundaries and enabled us to learn more about the educational system and practices outside of Singapore.
