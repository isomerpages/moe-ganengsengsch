A very good morning to Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, Mr Chung, colleagues and Gessians. For today’s Take 5, I will be focusing on the School Value of Resilience as well as some important school events which will be taking place very soon. Please take out your GESS LIFE Book and take down some notes.

Resilience or Learning to overcome life’s challenges is one of our school’s four Core Values. And this value of Resilience is exemplified by Mr Jason Chee. You may remember Mr Jason Chee as the Navy serviceman who was working on board a Republic of Singapore warship when an unfortunate accident caused him to lose both his legs, his left arm and three fingers on his right hand. Can you imagine the pain and suffering he had to go through? Can you imagine losing your ability to walk and to lead a normal life overnight? For many people, this accident would have left them distraught and wallowing in self-pity. But NOT Jason. He did not let his disabilities get him down. Instead, he picked himself up and bounced back and accomplished more than what most average Singaporeans are capable of. In a mere three years after the accident, he did Singapore proud by leading the table-tennis team to Gold in the 8th ASEAN Para Games. This was the first time Singapore had won a gold medal in this sport in the APG. What he accomplished despite his personal tragedy was truly remarkable. Not stopping there, he is planning to qualify for the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo and is also currently studying Mathematics in UniSIM. In his own words, he is “not the sort of person who gives up easily”. His mantra in life is “If I don’t give up, I will fulfil anything that I want.” We should all emulate Mr Jason Chee for his never say die attitude and ability to bounce back from personal setbacks.

Starting this week, the Sec2s will be submitting their files for File Check. In the following weeks, the Upper Secondary students will be doing the same. Through the File Check, we wish to cultivate in you the value of Discipline, specifically Self-Discipline. We want you to learn to be independent and to be responsible for your own learning and your own progress. This value would stand you in good stead to face Life’s many and varied challenges even as you leave the gates of your alma mater.

The English department will be conducting oral examinations for the Sec3 NA and Express students this week. Oral exams teach us to think on our feet and hone our ability to communicate well with others. Both are important skills we need for the workplace of the future.

Sports Thursday will be held on 23 March, and an exciting afternoon of sports and games awaits us. There will be futsal, basketball, floorball, netball and perhaps field football too. This will be an afternoon where we can let our hair down and just enjoy some recreational games with our classmates, friends and buddies. Just as we work hard, we play hard as well. Remember, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy and Jill a dull girl.

The Meet the Parents Session for Sec2-5 students and Prize Presentation Ceremony for the Sec2s and 3s will be held this coming Friday evening. We will be Celebrating the Good and recognising the achievements of our Sec2 and 3 students who have done well in their examinations in the previous year.

As we can see, an exciting week lies ahead of us. Let us make the most of this and do the best we can in all that we do. Onward!
