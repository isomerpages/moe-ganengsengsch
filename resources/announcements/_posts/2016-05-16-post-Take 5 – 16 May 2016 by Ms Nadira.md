Good morning Mdm Tan, Mr Lee, teachers and fellow Gessians. It is my pleasure to deliver this morning’s Take 5.

This week we commemorate the Kindness Movement with the theme, “Kindness, it’s up to us”. In line with this theme, a recent article published in the Straits Times highlights the issue of public shaming. To bring this issue to light, two situations were surfaced.

The first is, ‘If you see a man fast asleep in a reserved seat and on a crowded train and next to him is a pregnant commuter who has one hand on her baby bump and the other holding the metal rail tightly, – What would you do? Would you put the situation right by waking the man up to give up his seat or resort to taking a photo to shame him online?

The second situation is on the wedding photos of a couple that has gone viral for their poor quality. The album was shared more than 20, 000 times on Facebook. Although the name of the photographer responsible for this mishap was not mentioned, many netizens were trying to ferret out his identity. Eventually, the photographer responded with a public apology. Though, the couple who uploaded has no intention of shaming anyone, they too have been criticised for their actions.

So Gessians what can we learn from these two situations? First we must have the courage to do the right thing if we want to correct a situation. Merely exposing it for public scrutiny and shaming will not in any way rectify the state of affairs. Also, what we see on social media is all about perspective. What we understand might not always be the whole truth but just partial truth. We must therefore not jump to conclusion by disseminating or giving unnecessary comments on social media.

Secondly, we need to learn to be compassionate, thoughtful and affable people. Such traits will render us in good stead of always putting others above self. And when we do, we will always be encouraged to show kindness and consideration to everyone.

Thirdly, think before you act – ask yourselves would you be happy if you are the subject of any unkind act that has gone viral? How would you feel as a victim? By putting yourselves in the victim’s shoes, you would be more mindful of your actions.

Gessians, many a times, we get furious when people do not treat us graciously but fail to realise that sometimes subconsciously we too behave impolitely. So let’s us play our part in creating a nation of grace and kindness. Make kindness your way of life. Indeed, there is an innate kindness that lies with every one of us but the choice is up to us.

So remember to always know the good, desire the good and do the good.

With that, I end my Take 5. Have a blessed week ahead Gessians.

Thank you.
