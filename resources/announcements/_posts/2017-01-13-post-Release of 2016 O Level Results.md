GESS’s Class of 2016 performed very well in the GCE ‘O’ Level examination, with 96.9% and 64.4% of the Sec 4EX and Sec 5NA cohorts achieving at least 5 O-level passes respectively. Each year, 80% of our Sec 4EX are eligible to progress to JC, and 99% to Polytechnic for their post-secondary education. For our 5NA cohort, 6 subjects achieved percentage distinctions above the national average: Additional Math, Design & Technology, Math, Science (Physic/Chemistry), Science (Chemistry/Biology), and Principles of Accounts. For our 4EX cohort, 10 subjects achieved percentage distinctions above the national average: Additional Math, Chinese Language, Combined Humanities, Design & Technology, Higher Chinese, Literature in English, Math, Malay, Physics, and Science (Physics/Chemistry).

GESS is very proud of our students’ achievements and we wish them all the best in their next lap of their journey in education, to fulfil their aspirations.

Principal, Mdm Jenny Tan, says that “I am delighted in the Class of 2016 who have achieved these very good results by knowing, desiring and doing the good, to achieve their potential and fulfil their aspirations. They have indeed learnt, played and lived life at GESS with all their energy and perseverance. As friends, they have supported each other in studying hard and showing resilience, and their very good CCA results are a good testimony of their holistic development as persons of character. I am also very happy that they have worked well under their teachers’ passionate dedication and guidance, and shown a strong desire to improve and progress onward. These qualities will place them in a strong position to thrive in their post-secondary education journey and in their adult life. Most of all, we celebrate the support from teachers, partners and support staff in coming together as a community to give them the encouragement and nurturing for the graduating class.”

Mr Chan Hoong Leong, our Senior Teacher for Physics, said that “Being the Dragon babies, the 2016 graduands had exhibited resilience and demonstrated the fire of leadership. In the journey towards the ‘O’ level examination, many of them showed much support for one another while finishing their last lap in GESS. It was heartwarming to see their hard work and effort pay off. I look forward to seeing them contribute back to the school and the community. Onward, Gessians!”
