Racial Harmony Day

Singapore is a vibrant country with the 4 different races, namely Malay, Indians, Chinese and Eurasians. We get to learn the different cultures, taste the different food and even learn the different languages from our friends of different races. Our nation’s founding fathers worked very hard to build the strong bonds and trust among Singaporeans, giving all a vibrant and peaceful society to live in. We need to protect and strengthen this legacy we have. Quoting our Minister of Home Affairs and Law, Mr K Shanmugam in a speech earlier this year; “We are one of the most religiously diverse, and tolerant societies in the world, where mosques, churches and temples are situated side by side.” Singapore is unique in one way because of the racial harmony that we have, but Singapore can also be in a chaotic state if the 4 different races are not able to work together. We should not take things for granted, but treasure and appreciate the bonds and respect we have amongst the 4 different races. Like what Mr K Shanmugam said in the same speech; “If we remain resolutely ‘us’, one united people, regardless of race, language or religion, no force can divide us.”

Last year, 33 classes, 16 CCAs and staff members came together to decorate handprints for Racial Harmony Day. The decorated handprints are exhibited at the noticeboard near the conference room. We enjoyed traditional games such as the flag eraser game, pick up sticks and 5 stones during the level recesses. All of us regardless of our race, culture or religion, came together to learn, play and had fun. This year, the theme for Racial Harmony Day is Our Cultural Heritage. I know from the organising committee that they have lined up interesting activities for all of us to take part in.

Allow me to just share with you some of the activities that they have prepared for you. There will be quizzes during the morning assembly where prizes can be won. Next, during your respective level recesses, you can win packets of food that are related to the 4 different races such as fish and chips, chicken biryani, fried mee and fried mee siam. The organising committee hopes that through these activities, we can understand the customs and traditions of the different races and religions, learn to respect these customs and traditions and therefore, strengthen the bond of understanding and trust between us, that we may continue to be one united Singapore. Have an enjoyable week!

Thank you.
