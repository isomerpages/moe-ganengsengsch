<p>GESS Rakan Bahasa, also known as Friends of the Malay Language, represented
the school in NITRA, alongside Haig Girls Primary School, Frontier Primary
School, Woodlands Ring Secondary School, Raffles Institution, Madrasah
Wak Tanjong Al-Islamiah and Catholic Junior College. The objectives of
NITRA are to provide a platform for students to read and appreciate Children
Malay Literature, and to provide a platform for students to share their
critical viewpoints about the chosen literary text. Our schoolmates also
volunteered to spend their Saturday morning at Frontier Primary School
to support this event</p>
