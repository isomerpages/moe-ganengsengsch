<p>GESS commemorated Total Defence day with activities planned for the whole
week. On Wednesday, we had TD talk and activity planned and carried out
by the Dragon Scouts. On Friday, we had Hi5 by Mrs Leong on TD40 and its
significance. We ended the week with an evacuation exercise and food resilience
lesson. Thank you, CCE team for planning these meaningful week long programme
for the students.</p>
