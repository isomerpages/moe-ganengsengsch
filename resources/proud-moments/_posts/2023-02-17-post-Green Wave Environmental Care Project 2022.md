The Entrepreneur Club (E-Club) participated in Green Wave Environmental Care Project 2022. On 16 February 2023, the E-Club received two awards: Merit Award $1,000 and Team Award $500. The awards were presented by Mr Chan Chun Sing. The title of the project is “Portal Vermicompost: Waste into Energy form the canteen”. The objective of this project is to have better waste management in the school canteen. Every award winner made his/her own portable vermiculture propagation set by using edible and non-edible waste from the canteen. Onward Gessians!
