<p>Initiated by the Student Development Team and spearheaded by Mr Clarence
Loh (YH), GESS student voice and agency took on a larger scale with student
leaders presenting their school improvement projects to school leaders,
OMs and fellow student leaders. It was a fruitful session where many ideas
were exchanged and we hope it will also inspire the younger student leaders
to model after their seniors to effect positive changes in school.</p>
