<p>GESS had the pleasure of hosting many international groups this year.
We had schools from Thailand, China and Korea who came to learn from us.
We had educators from all over the world who came to find out more about
our best practices. Our students' interaction with these participants would
certainly develop their communication and civic literacy skills.</p>
