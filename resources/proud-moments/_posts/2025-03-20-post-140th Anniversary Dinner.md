<p>GESS thanks GESSOSA for planning a very memorable 140th anniversary dinner
at Orchard Hotel on Friday. Graced by Dr Tan Wee Kiat, former CEO of Gardens
By The Bay and a senior Gessian, the event was attended by about 600 former
students, parents, former educators and partners. What a wonderful day!</p>
