GESS NPCC Unit commemorated NPCC Day on 29 May 2019. The GOH contingent has put on the Number 1 uniform for the parade to celebrate NPCC 60th Anniversary and GESS NPCC Unitâ€™s 50th Anniversary.

Once again, GESS NPCC Unit has achieved the UOPA Gold Unit Award for 2018. In addition, we have 2 recipients for the prestigious SPF-NPCC Award. They are SI(NPCC) Joshua Wong Zhuo Yi from class 4E and SI(NPCC) Eugene Kum You Quan from class 4C1.

We wish all NPCC officers and cadets a Happy NPCC Day!
