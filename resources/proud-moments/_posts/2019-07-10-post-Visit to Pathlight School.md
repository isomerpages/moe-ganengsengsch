On 24th June, GESSIANS spent one meaningful day at Pathlight School learning more about Artificial Intelligence. Through tinkering with Makeblock Halocode, they came out with innovative solutions to everyday household problems.

Through effective use of Design Thinking, they managed to impress the judges and their peers, clinching the Crowd Favourite Award and Most Innovative Award.

They were also crowned Overall Winner of the day. Onward Gessians!
