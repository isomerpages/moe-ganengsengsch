<p>At our Founder’s Day Prize Giving Ceremony, we celebrated the hard work
and achievements of our Gessians, and honoured our partners who played
a key role in developing our Gessians over the years. That as many hands
build a house, so many hearts make a school!
<br>
<br>Congratulations to all our prize winners! We are very proud of your achievement!</p>
