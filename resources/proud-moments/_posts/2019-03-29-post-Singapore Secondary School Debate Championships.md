On 29 March (Fri), our debate team, inspite of the many demands on their time and energy, clinched a win against Naval base Secondary, with Jeron from 3H named as Best Speaker for their debate with the same school. Judges and teachers present commented that our team is very promising and has a lot of potential. Looking forward to 2020 for the next challenge!
