In line with GESS 21CC drive, the school hosted 27 staff and students from Suanboonyopatham Lamphun School (Chiang Mai, Thailand) today. 

Gessians had an enriching time getting to know more about Thailand, in particular, about Chiangmai and Lamphun. The Thai students' dance was refreshingly different. 

As host, Gessians rose to the occasion. Good Job!
