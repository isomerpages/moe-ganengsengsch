**About 80 Gan Eng Seng School students took turns on a zipline, abseil station, climbing wall and tower circuit for the first time since a fatal incident involving a rope course in 2021**

SINGAPORE: Schools in Singapore on Tuesday (Feb 1) resumed height-based activities but at a lower capacity, following a near two-year suspension prompted by a fatal incident during a camp programme.

At the Jalan Bahtera Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre, activities like the zipline, abseil station, climbing wall and tower circuit operated at 50 per cent or less of normal capacity, with more time allocated for students to participate in each activity

This also means that instructors will work with fewer students than usual.

This reduced tempo will be in place at all activity sites until Mar 31, to provide time for instructors to ease into their roles safely, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Tuesday. 

Gan Eng Seng School student Bao-Anh Nguyen, 15, said she had been looking forward to the activities. 

“I wasn’t scared, but more like excited ... because since we’re in Sec 3, we’re in a new class and we need to get to know our classmates,” she said, after tackling the tower circuit.

The Secondary 3 students were at Jalan Bahtera for a three-day camp. About 30 per cent of the cohort, or 80 students, got to try out the height-based activities for the first time since they were suspended in February 2021 - after a 15-year-old student died during a rope course at SAFRA Yishun.
