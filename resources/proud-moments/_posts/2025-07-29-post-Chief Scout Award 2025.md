<p>Four of our scouts had the honour of receiving the Chief Scout Award from
Ms Elysa Chen, Member of Parliament for Bishan - Toa Payoh GRC at the South
Area Chief Scout Awards &amp; Frank Cooper Sands Award Presentation Ceremony
on 26 July 2025.</p>
<p>The scouts are:</p>
<p>- Senior Patrol Leader Jaryl See Toh Jia Heng, 4-4</p>
<p>- ⁠Senior Patrol Leader Jonas Kh’ng Heng Qi, 4-6</p>
<p>- Senior Patrol Leader Liaw Ye Cheng Jerome, 4-4</p>
<p>- ⁠Patrol Leader Soo Wen Jie, 4-6</p>
<p>The Chief Scout Award is the highest award that can be attained by a student
under the scout section. This award not only represents their passion and
dedication for scouts but also a testament of their resilience as they
overcame many challenges along the way. More than just an award, it represents
their friendship and treasured memories.</p>
<p>In addition, we are also proud to update that both our scout and venture
units were awarded the Frank Cooper Sands Award.</p>
<p>This is an award to recognise units that had displayed excellence in six
key areas: youth development, youth service, unit activities, unit participation,
international participation, and adult training and development.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Dragon Scout Group! Onward!</p>
