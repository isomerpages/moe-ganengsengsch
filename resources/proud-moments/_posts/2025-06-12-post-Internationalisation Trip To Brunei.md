<p>Day 1: We explore the heart of Brunei’s heritage on Day 1 - Kampong Ayer,
the iconic water village known as the 'Venice of the East.' Kampong Ayer
is the home to generations of Bruneians, this living heritage stands as
a testament to the nation's rich cultural roots and enduring traditions.
A must-visit to truly understand Brunei’s soul.</p>
<p>Day 2: We had our moment of awe at the Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque,
a true icon of Brunei. This majestic landmark is both a spiritual sanctuary
and an architectural masterpiece. Its 29 golden pillars stand in tribute
to Brunei’s 29th Sultan - a powerful symbol of faith, heritage, and national
pride. Next, we stepped out of our comfort zones with a taste of sago worms,
served two ways: alive &amp; raw, and freshly-fried. A true local delicacy
and sustainable protein source! We also savored Ambuyat, Brunei’s national
dish, made from the starchy interior of the sago palm. Though mild in taste,
it’s all about the dipping sauces and shared experience - a beautiful reflection
of Bruneian culture.</p>
<p>Day 3: We were warmly welcomed at Menglait Secondary School - the heart
of our overseas exchange experience. From the moment we stepped in, we
were greeted with warm greetings, bright smiles, and genuine hospitality.
It was truly heartening to connect with the students and staff, and to
witness the spirit of friendship and cultural exchange in action. Gessians
had fun attending lessons, such as Islamic Religious Knowledge, Melayu
Islam Beraja and Commerce with their buddies. In the afternoon, we visited
the Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque. The mosque is recognisable by its gold
dome that dominates the city's skyline and is situated in the middle of
a man-made lagoon with a ceremonial stone barge. The inside of the mosque
is decorated with rugs from Saudi Arabia and walls made of Italian marble.</p>
<p>Day 4: A meaningful morning back at Menglait Secondary School — this time,
to share a piece of our story. We gave a presentation about GESS, offering
our new friends a glimpse into our school’s environment, culture, and community.
As a special highlight, we put on a dance performance and invited our buddies
to join in - the school hall lit up with laughter, music, and unforgettable
memories! Next, it was games time! Girls teamed up for netball and volleyball,
while the boys played a friendly futsal match. It was a joy to see smiles,
teamwork, and true sportsmanship in action - proof that sports can unite
people across cultures. The day continued with a beautifully planned cultural
showcase by the student leaders of Menglait Secondary School. We played
traditional games like five stones, congkak, and layang-layang, tried on
traditional costumes, and sampled local treats like kueh cincin and pinyaram.
Our overseas exchange programme in Brunei came to a heartfelt close with
a meaningful exchange of souvenirs between the two schools and between
buddies from Menglait Secondary School and GESS. These tokens were not
just gifts as they symbolised the friendships we have built, the cultures
we have shared, and the memories we will carry with us for a long time
to come. Saying goodbye was not easy. We left not just as visitors, but
as part of a growing global family. The entire experience was more than
just a school exchange, but a journey of connection, understanding, and
personal growth. We are returning home with new perspectives, meaningful
stories, and a renewed appreciation for the power of cultural exchange.</p>
