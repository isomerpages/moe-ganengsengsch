Sec 4/5 ECG Programme cum Learning Journey was held on Wed, 8 Feb 2023. The programme provided opportunities for students to learn more about what Institutes of higher learning can offer them and also exposed them to the real world of work. The learning journey was indeed an eye-opener for the students. They visited places like the Life-long Learning Exploration Centre, Land Transport Authority (Circle Line Project Information Centre) and other industries of their interest.
