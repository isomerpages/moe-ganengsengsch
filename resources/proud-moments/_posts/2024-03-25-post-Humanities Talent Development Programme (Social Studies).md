<p>The students of the Humanities Talent Development Programme (Social Studies)
took part in the River Valley Model United Nations 2024 (RVMUN) which was
held between 11 â€“ 13 March during the school holidays. During the 3-day
conference, students engaged in debates and discussions on relevant and
real-life issues pertaining to sustainability, such as addressing barriers
to green economy and vehicle effects on carbon emissions.</p>
<p>We are proud to share that our student, Sim Jing Yuan, Aiden (3-4), was
chosen as the Best Delegate for his council, United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP). The award is given to the delegate who has displayed
outstanding public speaking, negotiation skills, diplomacy, and overall
performance during the conference.</p>
