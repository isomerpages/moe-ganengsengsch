<p>Our Chinese, Malay, and Tamil students have actively participated in a
variety of activities and competitions over the past few months. These
events were organised by various organisations, including the Committee
to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Malay Language Council
of Singapore, and the Association of Singapore Tamil Writers. We are proud
to share that our students have achieved outstanding results, emerging
as winners in several competitions such as the National Schools Xinyao
Singing and Songwriting Competition, The GoodTalk (Global Village) International
Youth Bilingual Speech Conference, and the Short Film-Making Competition.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our winners!</p>
