Gan Eng Seng School celebrated Chinese New Year with acrobatic performances, competitions, unicycling and lion dance. What a joyous occasion! Thank you Mr Wong Peng Meng, President of Gessosa,for gracing the event as the Guest-of-Honour. Thank you SAC, PTA members and parents for making this day special. Message for Gessians, use less of handphone, eat in moderation, do more reading and of course have a lot of face to face interactions with your loved ones. Wishing all a happy, healthy and successful Year Of The Rat!
