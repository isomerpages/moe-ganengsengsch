**Secondary 1 CCE – “A Touch Of Love” workshop**

From this workshop, the Sec 1s learnt that hospice care is not about finding cure for diseases but maximizing the quality of life for people having life limiting illnesses.

After the workshop, the Sec 1s unleashed their creativity to design cards for someone diagnosed with chronic illnesses. They also penned down carefully and with sensitivities words and phrases that can encourage the hospice patients.

Onward Gessians!
