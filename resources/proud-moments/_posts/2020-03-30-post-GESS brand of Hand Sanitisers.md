Hand sanitisers were sold out in shops, so Gessians, Operations Manager, support staff and teachers joined force to produce our own brand of hand sanitisers using the recipe from World Health Organisation. With the help of the Staff Welfare Committee, more than 130 bottles were given out to all staff. We hope to be at the top of our game against COVID-19 and continue to stay vigilant. Onward!
