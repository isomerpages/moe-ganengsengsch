<p>In the month of May, a group of Gessians passionate about STEM took part
in the IDE (Innovation, Design and Engineering) series competition, which
challenges students across various STEM domains. Our Gessians participated
in 3 events: Code Builder, Code Hacker and IDE Maker. We are proud to announce
that one of our Maker teams has obtained a second place finish. Congratulations
on a job well done!</p>
